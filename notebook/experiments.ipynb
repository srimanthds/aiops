They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs,Llama 2and\\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chatmodels generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development ofLlama 2andLlama 2-Chat, such as\\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\\n3'),\n",

Llama 2, an updated version ofLlama 1, trained on a new mix of publicly available data. We also\\nincreased the size of the pretraining corpus by 40%, doubled the context length of the model, and\\nadopted grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023).

Llama 2-Chat, a fine-tuned version ofLlama 2that is optimized for dialogue use cases. We release\\nvariants of this model with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters as well.\\nWe believe that the open release of LLMs, when done safely, will be a net benefit to society. Like all LLMs,\\nLlama 2is a new technology that carries potential risks with use (Bender et al., 2021b; Weidinger et al., 2021;\\nSolaiman et al., 2023). Testing conducted to date has been in English and has not — and could not — cover\\nall scenarios. Therefore, before deploying any applications ofLlama 2-Chat, developers should perform\\nsafety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.

We made an effort to remove data from certain sites known to contain a\\nhigh volume of personal information about private individuals. We trained on 2 trillion tokens of data as this\\nprovides a good performance–cost trade-off, up-sampling the most factual sources in an effort to increase\\nknowledge and dampen hallucinations.\\nWe performed a variety of pretraining data investigations so that users can better understand the potential\\ncapabilities and limitations of our models; results can be found in Section 4.1.\\n2.2 Training Details\\nWe adopt most of the pretraining setting and model architecture fromLlama 1. We use the standard\\ntransformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), apply pre-normalization using RMSNorm (Zhang and\\nSennrich, 2019), use the SwiGLU activation function (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary positional embeddings\\n(RoPE, Su et al. 2022). The primary architectural differences fromLlama 1include increased context length\\nand grouped-query attention (GQA).

As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data,\\nas illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but\\nhigher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved. These\\nfindingsaresimilarinspirittoZhouetal.(2023),whichalsofindsthatalimitedsetofcleaninstruction-tuning\\ndata can be sufficient to reach a high level of quality. We found that SFT annotations in the order of tens of\\nthousands was enough to achieve a high-quality result. We stopped annotating SFT after collecting a total of\\n27,540 annotations. Note that we do not include any Meta user data.\\nWe also observed that different annotation platforms and vendors can result in markedly different down-\\nstream model performance, highlighting the importance of data checks even when using vendors to source\\nannotations. Tovalidateourdataquality,wecarefullyexaminedasetof180examples,comparingtheannota-\\ntions provided by humans with the samples generated by the model through manual scrutiny. Surprisingly,\\nwe found that the outputs sampled from the resulting SFT model were often competitive with SFT data\\nhandwritten by human annotators, suggesting that we could reprioritize and devote more annotation effort\\nto preference-based annotation for RLHF.\\nFine-Tuning Details. For supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial\\nlearning rate of2 × 10−5, a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.\\nFor the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer. To ensure the model sequence\\nlength is properly filled, we concatenate all the prompts and answers from the training set. A special token is\\nutilized to separate the prompt and answer segments. We utilize an autoregressive objective and zero-out\\nthe loss on tokens from the user prompt, so as a result, we backpropagate only on answer tokens.

We chose a binary comparison protocol over\\nother schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other\\nstrategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work.\\nOur annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose\\nbetween two sampled model responses, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the\\ntworesponsestoagivenpromptaresampledfromtwodifferentmodelvariants,andvaryingthetemperature\\nhyper-parameter. Inadditiontogivingparticipantsaforcedchoice,wealsoaskannotatorstolabelthedegree\\nto which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice issignificantly better, better,\\nslightly better, ornegligibly better/ unsure.\\nFor our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how\\nwell Llama 2-Chatresponses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to\\nwhether Llama 2-Chat’s responses are unsafe, e.g.,“giving detailed instructions on making a bomb”could\\nbe considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to\\napply specific guidelines to each and better guide annotators; for example, our safety annotations provide\\ninstructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.\\nApart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.\\nThis additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response\\nis safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with\\n18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples\\nwhere the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be\\nbetter/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations\\ncan be found in Section 4.2.1.\\nHuman annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our\\nreward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions forLlama 2-Chat(see\\nthe results in Section 5, Figure 20).Llama 2-Chatimprovement also shifted the model’s data distribution.\\nSince reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from\\nhyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), it is important before a newLlama 2-Chattuning iteration to\\ngather new preference data using the latestLlama 2-Chatiterations. This step helps keep the reward model\\non-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.\\nIn Table 6, we report the statistics of reward modeling data that we collected over time, and present them\\nagainst multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al.,\\n2022a), OpenAI Summarize (Stiennon et al., 2020), OpenAI WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), StackExchange\\n(Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla).\\nWe collected a large dataset of over 1 million binary comparisons based on humans applying our specified\\nguidelines, which we refer to asMetareward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and\\nanswers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer\\nprompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our\\npreference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average.\\n3.2.2 Reward Modeling\\nThe reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous\\nturns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model\\ngeneration. Leveraging such response scores as rewards, we can optimizeLlama 2-Chatduring RLHF for\\nbetter human preference alignment and improved helpfulness and safety.\\nOthers have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it\\nchallenging for a single reward model to perform well on both. To address this, we train two separate reward\\nmodels, one optimized for helpfulness (referred to asHelpfulness RM) and another for safety (Safety RM).\\nWe initialize our reward models from pretrained chat model checkpoints, as it ensures that both models\\nbenefit from knowledge acquired in pretraining. In short, the reward model “knows” what the chat model\\n10'),\n",

This prevents cases where, for instance, the two models would have an information mismatch, which\\ncould result in favoring hallucinations. The model architecture and hyper-parameters are identical to those\\nof the pretrained language models, except that the classification head for next-token prediction is replaced\\nwith a regression head for outputting a scalar reward.\\nTraining Objectives. To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data\\ninto a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher\\nscore than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al. (2022):\\nLranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) − rθ(x, yr))) (1)\\nwhere rθ(x, y) is the scalar score output for promptx and completiony with model weightsθ. yc is the\\npreferred response that annotators choose andyr is the rejected counterpart.\\nBuilt on top of this binary ranking loss, we further modify it separately for better helpfulness and safety\\nreward models as follows. Given that our preference ratings is decomposed as a scale of four points (e.g.,\\nsignificantly better), as presented in Section 3.2.1, it can be useful to leverage this information to explicitly\\nteach the reward model to assign more discrepant scores to the generations that have more differences. To\\ndo so, we further add a margin component in the loss:\\nLranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) − rθ(x, yr) − m(r))) (2)\\nwhere the marginm(r) is a discrete function of the preference rating. Naturally, we use a large margin\\nfor pairs with distinct responses, and a smaller one for those with similar responses (shown in Table 27).\\nWe found this margin component can improve Helpfulness reward model accuracy especially on samples\\nwhere two responses are more separable.

As a result, optimizing two separate models eases the reward modeling\\ntask. More detailed analysis on this tension between safety and helpfulness can be found in Appendix A.4.1.\\nWhen we group the scores by preference rating in Table 8, we can see that the accuracy is superior for the\\n“significantlybetter”testsetanddegradesgraduallyascomparisonpairsbecomemoresimilar(e.g.,“slightly\\nbetter”).

We note that reward model accuracy is one of the most\\nimportant proxies for the final performance ofLlama 2-Chat. While best practices for comprehensively\\nevaluating a generative model is an open research question, the ranking task of the reward has no ambiguity.\\nTherefore, everything else being equal, an improvement of the reward model can be directly translated into\\nan improvement forLlama 2-Chat.\\n3.2.3 Iterative Fine-Tuning\\nAs we received more batches of human preference data annotation, we were able to train better reward\\nmodels and collect more prompts.

This mitigation can be seen as analogous to Synnaeve et al. (2019) and Vinyals\\net al. (2019) in the RL literature.\\nWe illustrate the benefit of Rejection Sampling in Figure 7. The delta between the maximum and median\\ncurves can be interpreted as the potential gain of fine-tuning on the best output. As expected, this delta\\nincreases with more samples, since the maximum increases (i.e., more samples, more opportunities to\\ngenerate a good trajectory), while the median remains stationary. There is a direct connection between the\\nexploration and the maximum reward we can obtain among the samples. The temperature parameter also\\nplays an important role for exploration, as a higher temperature enables us to sample more diverse outputs.\\nIn Figure 8, we report for aLlama 2-Chat-SFT (left) and aLlama 2-Chat-RLHF (right), the maximum\\nreward curves among N samples (withN ∈ [1, . . . ,100]), for different temperatures. We can observe that\\nthe optimal temperature is not constant during the iterative model updates: RLHF has a direct impact on\\nrescaling the temperature. ForLlama 2-Chat-RLHF, the optimal temperature when sampling between 10\\nand 100 outputs isT ∈ [1.2, 1.3]. Given a finite compute budget, it is therefore necessary to re-adjust the\\ntemperature progressively.

We were able to mitigate this by consolidating the model weights to each node once before generation\\nand then freeing the memory after generation, resuming the rest of the training loop.\\n3.3 System Message for Multi-Turn Consistency\\nIn a dialogue setup, some instructions should apply for all the conversation turns, e.g., to respond succinctly,\\nor to“act as”some public figure. When we provided such instructions toLlama 2-Chat, the subsequent\\nresponse should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial\\ninstruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).\\nTo address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context\\nDistillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage\\nprocess. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).\\nGAtt Method. Assume we have access to a multi-turn dialogue dataset between two persons (e.g., a user\\nand an assistant), with a list of messages[u1, a1, . . . , un, an], whereun and an correspond to the user and\\nassistant messages for turnn, respectively. Then, we define an instruction,inst, that should be respected\\nthroughout the dialogue. For example,inst could be“act as.”We can then synthetically concatenate this\\ninstruction to all the user messages of the conversation.\\nNext, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue\\nand the sample with which to fine-tune a model, in a process analogous to Rejection Sampling. Instead of\\naugmenting all context-dialogue turns with the instruction, we can drop it in all but the first turn, but this\\nwould lead to a mismatch at training time between the system message, i.e., all the intermediate assistant\\nmessages that come before the last turn, and our sample. To fix this issue, which could hurt the training, we\\nsimply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.\\nFor the training instructions, we created a few synthetic constraints to sample from: Hobbies (“You enjoy\\ne.g. Tennis”), Language (“Speak in e.g. French”), or Public Figure (“Act as e.g. Napoleon”). To obtain the lists\\nof hobbies and public figures, we askedLlama 2-Chatto generate it, avoiding a mismatch between the\\ninstruction and model knowledge (e.g., asking the model to act as someone it had not encountered during\\ntraining).

Human evaluation, while a gold standard, can\\nbe complicated by various HCI considerations (Clark et al., 2021; Gehrmann et al., 2023), and is not always\\nscalable. Thus, to select the best-performing models among several ablations at each iteration from RLHF-V1\\nto V5, we first observed the improvement of the rewards from the latest reward models, to save costs and\\nincrease iteration speed. We later validated major model versions with human evaluations.\\nHow Far Can Model-Based Evaluation Go?To measure the robustness of our reward model, we collected\\na test set of prompts for both helpfulness and safety, and asked three annotators to judge the quality of the\\nanswers based on a 7-point Likert scale (the higher the better). We observe that our reward models overall\\nare well calibrated with our human preference annotations, as illustrated in Figure 29 in the appendix.

We also share a model card in the Appendix, in Table 52.\\n4.1 Safety in Pretraining\\nIt is important to understand what is in the pretraining data both to increase transparency and to shed\\nlight on root causes of potential downstream issues, such as potential biases. This can inform what, if any,\\ndownstream mitigations to consider, and help guide appropriate model use. In this section, we analyze the\\npretraining data for distributions of languages, demographic representations, and toxicity. We also present\\nthe results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.\\nSteps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly.We followed Meta’s standard privacy and legal review processes for\\neach dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain\\nsites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We made a best\\neffort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our\\nmodelsbroadlywillreducetheneedforotherstotrainsimilarmodels. Noadditionalfilteringwasconducted\\non the datasets, to allowLlama 2to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate\\nspeechclassification), whileavoidingthepotentialfortheaccidentaldemographicerasuresometimescaused\\nby over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allowsLlama 2-Chatto generalize more effectively during safety tuning\\nwith fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result,Llama 2models\\nshould be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.\\nDemographic Representation: Pronouns. Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited\\nfrom the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words\\nrepresenting “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing“men”than to words\\nrepresenting“women,”and Ganeshet al.(2023) demonstrates that amodel’sperformance onfairness metrics\\ncan be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic\\ngroups. Within our English-language training corpus, we computed the frequencies of the most common\\nEnglish pronouns in Table 9a. We observe thatHe pronouns are generally overrepresented in documents\\ncompared toShe pronouns, echoing similar frequency differences observed in pronominal usage for similarly\\nsized model pretraining datasets (Chowdhery et al., 2022). This could mean that the model is learning less\\nduring pretraining about context that mentionsShe pronouns, and subsequently may potentially generateHe\\npronouns at a higher rate thanShe pronouns.\\nDemographic Representation: Identities. We also analyze the representation of different demographic\\ngroupsinthepretrainingdatabymeasuringratesofusageofdemographicidentitytermsfromtheHolisticBias\\ndataset (Smith et al., 2022) as a proxy. We compute frequencies for each descriptor term in the pretraining\\ncorpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes (Religion, Gender and Sex, Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and\\nSexual Orientation), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few\\nterms such as“straight,” “white,”and “black,”because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic\\nmentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in\\nboth Gender and Sexand Sexual Orientation. ForGender and Sex, whileShe pronouns are mentioned\\nin fewer documents, the term“female” is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply\\nthat while there is less frequent context aboutShe pronouns, comments about“females”are more prevalent,\\nperhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms (Blodgett et al., 2021). ForSexual\\nOrientation, the top five terms all relate to LGBTQ+ identities. ForNationality,Race and Ethnicity, and\\nReligion, we observe a Western skew (Bhatt et al., 2022). For instance, the term“American”is mentioned in\\n69.4% of the references, the term“European”is more prevalent than other race and ethnicity, and“Christian”\\nis the most represented religion followed by“Catholic”and “Jewish.”\\n20'),\n",

Truthfulness, referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconcep-\\ntions or false beliefs. We employTruthfulQA(Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can\\ngenerate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense.\\n2. Toxicity,definedasthetendencyofalanguagemodeltogeneratetoxic,rude,adversarial,orimplicitly\\nhateful content. We chooseToxiGen(Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation\\nof toxic language and hate speech across different groups.\\n3. Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with\\ndemographic attributes.\\nWe compare the performance ofLlama 2with Llama 1(Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,\\n2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to0.1\\nand use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better). For ToxiGen, we\\npresent the percentage of generations that are deemed toxic by the metric (the lower, the better). Detailed\\ndescriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix A.4.7. When compared toLlama 1-7B,\\nLlama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in\\ntoxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70BLlama 2, which may result\\nfrom larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship\\nbetween pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical\\nwork to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and\\nfurther evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.\\nIn Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with\\ndemographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using\\nBOLDprompts.

Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may\\nenable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection),\\nand it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups.

Further\\ntesting and mitigation should be done to understand bias and other social issues for the specific context\\nin which a system may be deployed. For this, it may be necessary to test beyond the groups available in\\nthe BOLD dataset (race, religion, and gender). As LLMs are integrated and deployed, we look forward to\\ncontinuing research that will amplify their potential for positive impact on these important social issues.\\n4.2 Safety Fine-Tuning\\nIn this section, we describe our approach to safety fine-tuning, including safety categories, annotation\\nguidelines, and the techniques we use to mitigate safety risks. We employ a process similar to the general\\nfine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.\\nSpecifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\\n1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-\\ntions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches\\nthe model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for\\nhigh-quality human preference data annotation.\\n2. Safety RLHF: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-\\ntion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging\\nadversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.\\n3. Safety Context Distillation: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation (Askell\\net al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety\\npreprompt, e.g.,“You are a safe and responsible assistant,”and then fine-tuning the model on the safer\\nresponses without the preprompt, which essentiallydistillsthe safety preprompt (context) into the\\nmodel. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use\\ncontext distillation for each sample.\\n4.2.1 Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines\\nBased on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to\\ncreate adversarial prompts along two dimensions: arisk category, or potential topic about which the LLM\\ncould produce unsafe content; and anattack vector, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts\\nthat could elicit bad model behaviors.\\nTheriskcategoriesconsideredcanbebroadlydividedintothefollowingthreecategories: illicitandcriminal\\nactivities(e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking);hateful and harmful activities(e.g., defamation, self-\\nharm, eating disorders, discrimination); andunqualified advice(e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal\\n23'),\n",

The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are\\niteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.\\n4.2.2 Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nIn accordance with the established guidelines from Section 4.2.1, we gather prompts and demonstrations\\nof safe model responses from trained annotators, and use the data for supervised fine-tuning in the same\\nmanner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5.\\nThe annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce\\nthe model to exhibit unsafe behavior, i.e., perform red teaming, as defined by the guidelines. Subsequently,\\nannotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce.\\n4.2.3 Safety RLHF\\nWeobserveearlyinthedevelopmentof Llama 2-Chatthatitisabletogeneralizefromthesafedemonstrations\\ninsupervisedfine-tuning.

Comprehensive tuning with RLHF has the added\\nbenefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts (Bai et al., 2022a).\\nWe conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section 3.2.2: annotators\\nwrite a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to\\nthe prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines. We then use the human\\npreference data to train a safety reward model (see Section 3.2.2), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to\\nsample from the model during the RLHF stage.\\nBetter Long-Tail Safety Robustness without Hurting HelpfulnessSafety is inherently a long-tail problem,\\nwhere the challenge comes from a small number of very specific cases. We investigate the impact of Safety\\nRLHFbytakingtwointermediate Llama 2-Chatcheckpoints—onewithoutadversarialpromptsintheRLHF\\nstage and one with them—and score their responses on our test sets using our safety and helpfulness reward\\nmodels. In Figure 14, we plot the score distribution shift of the safety RM on the safety test set (left) and that\\nof the helpfulness RM on the helpfulness test set (right). In the left hand side of the figure, we observe that\\nthe distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with\\nRLHF, and that the long tail of the distribution near zero thins out. A clear cluster appears on the top-left\\ncorner suggesting the improvements of model safety. On the right side, we do not observe any gathering\\npattern below they = x line on the right hand side of Figure 14, which indicates that the helpfulness score\\ndistributionispreservedaftersafetytuningwithRLHF.Putanotherway,givensufficienthelpfulnesstraining\\ndata, the addition of an additional stage of safety mitigation does not negatively impact model performance\\non helpfulness to any notable degradation. A qualitative example is shown in Table 12.\\nImpact of Safety Data Scaling.A tension between helpfulness and safety of LLMs has been observed in\\nprevious studies (Bai et al., 2022a).

We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various\\nadjectivesusuallyassociatedwithsafebehaviorsuchas “responsible,”“respectful’,’ or“wise,”withtheintuition\\nthat the model associates them with positive traits that we want to see reflected in safe answers.

We thus leverage the safety reward model to decide whether to use safety context\\ndistillation – we keep the context-distilled output only on the examples where it gets a better reward model\\nscore than the original answer.

After creating each dialogue, the red team participant would annotate various attributes, including\\nrisk areas and degree of risk, as captured by a 5-point Likert scale.\\nSome examples of useful insights provided by members of red teams that we were able to improve upon\\nthroughout development:\\n• [Early models] were more likely to have generated unsafe responses without noting that they con-\\ntain problematic content. However,[slightly later models] have tended to display knowledge\\nthat the content is problematic, even if they do go on to provide it.“They respond with ‘[UNSAFE\\nCONTENT] is not appropriate to discuss, etc.’ and then immediately follow up with ‘With that said, here’s\\nhow [UNSAFE CONTENT].’ ”[Latest models] are able to resolve these issues.\\n• Distracting the[early models] by including “quirks” or specific requests usually defeated any\\nreluctance encountered via more direct requests.“A creative writing request (song, story, poem, etc.) is a\\nreliable way to get it to produce content that it is otherwise robust against.”\\n• Embedding a problematic request in a positive context often successfully obscured the fact that\\nproblematic output was being requested for[early models]: “The overall principle I’ve found most\\neffective for any kind of attack is to hide it in language that is positive, progressive, and empowering.”\\nFrom Red Teaming Insights to Safer Models.Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough\\nanalysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-\\nformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk. In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide\\nto help further model safety training, and specifically took data from these exercises for model fine-tuning,\\nmodel feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.\\nMultiple additional rounds of red teaming were performed over several months to measure the robustness\\nof each new model as it was released internally. We defined the robustness of a model,γ, with respect to\\na red teaming exercise executed by a set of experts as the average number of created prompts that would\\ntriggeraviolatingresponsefromthemodelperpersonperhour. Asanexample, onour7Bmodel, wehadan\\nevolution ofγ : 1.8 → 0.45 over several red teaming iterations and model refinements. Robustness will likely\\ncontinue to improve with additional red teaming efforts. Another magnitude that we tracked as new models\\nwere produced was the percentage of prompts triggering violating responses discovered in the previous red\\nteaming exercises that were mitigated in a given new candidate release.

We then discuss the\\nlimitations ofLlama 2-Chat(Section 5.2). Lastly, we present our strategy for responsibly releasing these\\nmodels (Section 5.3).\\n5.1 Learnings and Observations\\nOur tuning process revealed several interesting results, such asLlama 2-Chat’s abilities to temporally\\norganize its knowledge, or to call APIs for external tools.\\nSFT (Mix)\\nSFT (Annotation)\\nRLHF (V1)\\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\\nReward Model Score\\nRLHF (V2)\\nFigure 20: Distribution shift for progressive versions ofLlama 2-Chat, from SFT models towards RLHF.\\nBeyond Human Supervision. At the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for\\nsupervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-\\nbility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement\\nlearning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore\\nthat the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs\\nthroughout the annotation process.\\nEven with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on\\nSFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Fur-\\nthermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human\\nannotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation\\nfor RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end\\ndistribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we\\ncan see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.\\nIn addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the\\nbestannotatorsmaynotchart. Nonetheless,humanscanstillprovidevaluablefeedbackwhencomparingtwo\\nanswers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished\\nartists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of\\nLLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as\\ndocumented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold\\nstandard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of “supervision.”\\nIn-ContextTemperatureRescaling. WehaveobservedanintriguingphenomenonrelatedtoRLHF,afeature\\nnotpreviouslyreportedtothebestofourknowledge: thedynamicre-scalingoftemperaturecontingentupon\\nthe context. As indicated in Figure 8, the temperature appears to be influenced by RLHF. Yet, intriguingly,\\nour findings also revealed that the shifts are not uniformly applied across all prompts, as shown in Figure 21.\\nFor instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as “Write a poem,” an increase in\\ntemperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the\\nSelf-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model.\\nOntheotherhand,forpromptsbasedonfactualinformation,suchas“Whatisthecapitalof?” theSelf-BLEU\\nslope diminishes over time.

This\\napproach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech\\ncompanies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued\\nin Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,\\ndemocratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI\\nexpertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress\\nin the industry.

Toxic content generation and\\nproblematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this\\npaper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we\\nrecognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and\\ncollaboration with the AI community.\\n6 Related Work\\nLarge Language Models. The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\\nthis progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference\\n(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\\nsource models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon\\n(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.\\n§§https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n35'),\n",

These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with\\nhuman preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the\\nopen-source community.\\nAttempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\\nand Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022).

An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in\\nwhich models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase\\nthe likelihood that their final answer is correct.\\nRLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant\\nimprovements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al.\\n(2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications.\\nIn this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the\\nmodels’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.\\nOuyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix\\nissues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai\\net al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled\\nfine-tuning data with the model’s own self-critiques and revisions, and by replacing human raters with a\\nmodel when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF).\\nKnown LLM Safety Challenges.Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked\\nwith Large Language Models.

We expand the context window forLlama 2from 2048 tokens to 4096 tokens. The longer\\ncontext window enables models to process more information, which is particularly useful for supporting\\nlonger histories in chat applications, various summarization tasks, and understanding longer documents.\\nTable 16 compares the performance of 2k and 4k context pretraining on long-context benchmarks. Both\\nmodelsaretrainedfor150Btokens,keepingthesamearchitectureandhyperparametersasabaseline,varying\\nonly the context length. We observe improvement on SCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2022), where the average\\ninput length is 3.5k, and no performance degradation on SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). Table 17 shows\\nthat the longer context model retains strong performance on various general-purpose tasks.\\nGrouped-Query Attention. A standard practice for autoregressive decoding is to cache the key (K) and\\nvalue (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation. With increasing\\ncontext windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache size in multi-head\\nattention (MHA) models grow significantly. For larger models, where KV cache size becomes a bottleneck,\\nkey and value projections can be shared across multiple heads without much degradation of performance\\n(Chowdheryetal.,2022). Eithertheoriginalmulti-queryformatwithasingleKVprojection(MQA, Shazeer,\\n2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\\nIn Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\\ntokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\\nMQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\\nlayers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\\nincrease it by a factor of1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the\\nMHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.\\nTo optimize for latency, we host our largest models using 8 A100s in a single node with tensor parallelism\\n(Shoeybi et al., 2019). In this setting, sharding for MQA cannot be done across heads anymore, given the\\nnumber of heads is lower than the number of GPUs. Either you duplicate the KV values in all GPUs (making\\nthe KV cache size equal to GQA), or an alternative is to shard across the batch dimension instead (Pope et al.,\\n2022). The latter, however, can complicate an inference service, as it works only when batch sizes are larger\\nthan the number of shards and the additional communication cost is not worth it in all cases.\\nContext NarrativeQA Qasper QuALITY QMSum ContractNLI SQuAD\\nLength (F1) (F1) (acc) (Rouge 1/2/L) (EM) (EM/F1)\\n2k 0.21 0.71 26.1 0.13/0.01/0.12 11.76 57.23/62.89\\n4k 17.26 18.52 29.6 15.08 /3.55/12.16 16.33 57.99 /64.46\\nTable 16: Context length ablation on long-context tasks.\\nContext Hella-Swag NQ TQA GSM8K Human-Eval\\nLength (0-shot) (64-shot) (64-shot) (8-shot) (0-shot)\\n2k 75.1 25.5 53.7 4.9 7.9\\n4k 74.8 25.5 52.2 6.5 7.3\\nTable 17: Context length ablation on general tasks.\\n47'),\n",

For all other tasks we report accuracy.\\nFigure 24: Multi-query variants enable higher throughput with larger batch sizes, and show similar\\nlatency on smaller batches.Output length is fixed at 128 tokens. The first data point corresponds to batch\\nsize 1, and then we double it until the model runs out of memory. The MHA variant triggers an out-of-\\nmemory error at a batch size of 1024 for a context of 256 tokens and at a batch size of 128 for 2k context,\\nwhereas MQA and GQA have successful runs in those settings.\\nTherefore, based on the ablation results and ease of scaling inference, for the 34B and 70BLlama 2models\\nwe chose to use GQA instead of MQA.\\nFigure 24 shows how inference speed changed for the 30B GQA and MQA ablation models compared to the\\nMHA baseline, in an experiment using 8 x 80 GiB A100s with tensor parallelism. In these runs we simply\\nduplicated the KV heads for MQA in all GPUs, so the KV cache size for MQA became equal to the GQA and\\nthe two variants behaved very similar (with MQA just having a slightly larger FFN dimension).\\nA.2.2 Additional Details for Pretrained Models Evaluation\\nMMLU details.

In total, we collected 14 batches of human\\npreference data (i.e., Meta Safety + Helpfulness) on a weekly basis, consisting of over 1 million binary model\\ngeneration comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over\\ntime and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We\\nalso intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the\\naverage number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.\\nIn Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share\\nof samples with similar responses (e.g.,negligibly better or unsure) increase dramatically over time while\\nthose with stronger preference (e.g.,significantly better) drop in the meantime. This reflects the nature of our\\niterative model update and preference data annotation procedure - with better-performingLlama 2-Chat\\nmodels used for response sampling over time, it becomes challenging for annotators to select a better one\\nfrom two equally high-quality responses.\\nA.3.2 Curriculum Strategy for Meta Human Preference Data\\nHigh quality data is critical for alignment as discussed for SFT. We worked closely with the annotation\\nplatforms during our fine-tuning process, and opted for a curriculum annotation strategy. With the first\\nmodel,theannotatorswereaskedtomakepromptsrelativelysimple,andthentoprogressivelymovetowards\\nmorecomplexpromptsandteachingnewskillsto Llama 2-Chat. Anillustrationofthiscurriculumannotation\\non our helpfulness preference data is displayed in Figure 26.\\nA.3.3 Ablation on Ranking Loss with Preference Rating-based Margin for Reward Modeling\\nWe ablated the ranking loss with the preference rating-based margin term for the helpfulness reward model.\\nWe tried two variants ofm(r) with different magnitude for the margin term in Eq 2 as listed open-source 27\\nandcomparethemagainstthebaselinewithoutthemarginterm. Wereportboththeirper-ratingandaverage\\naccuracy on the Meta Helpful test set in Table 28. We observe that the margin term can indeed help the\\nreward model perform better on more separable comparison pairs and a larger margin can boost it further.\\nHowever, the larger margin also regresses performance on similar samples.\\nWe further evaluated the impact of margin-based loss on reward score distribution shifts. We plot the\\nhistogram of reward scores from the test set in Figure 27. Essentially, the margin term pushes the reward\\n51'),\n",

We manually collected single turn prompts spanning the following categories: factual questions,\\nwriting and content creation, language assistance, recommendations, and dialogue. For multi-turn prompts,\\nannotators interacted with another model to generate a set of multi-turn prompts. To help ensure fairness,\\nwe asked annotators to collect multi-turn prompts by using four different interaction methods: (a) ChatGPT\\nas the interaction model, (b)Llama 2-Chatas the interaction model, (c) best response between ChatGPT\\nand Llama 2-Chatat every turn as selected by the annotators, (d) alternating between ChatGPT andLlama\\n2-Chat at every turn. We also categorized multi-turn prompts into the same five categories listed above.\\nSince it can be hard to categorize multi-turn prompts into a single category, annotators could select up to two\\ncategories for multi-turn prompts. Example evaluation prompts can be seen in Table 33.\\nFor open-source models, we collect generations using a context length of 1000 tokens and allow the model to\\ngenerate up to 1000 tokens. Even thoughLlama 2-Chatmodels are capable of handling up to 4000 tokens,\\nwe limit the context and generation length to 1000 tokens to provide a fair comparison with the open-source\\nmodels. Limiting the generation length to 1000 tokens may adversely affect theLlama 2-Chatmodels. Any\\nprompts that are longer than 1000 tokens are filtered out for evaluations with open sourced models.

To evaluate with closed source models, we collect another set of generations\\nwith 2000 context and generation length.\\nWhile collecting generations, we append a system prompt prior to the prompt for evaluation. The system\\nprompt for each model is shown in Table 31. Since ChatGPT, PaLM, and Falcon do not provide a system\\nprompt, we use the same system prompt asLlama 2-Chatmodel.

The questions are designed in a way that even\\nhumans might answer incorrectly because of an unfounded belief or misconception. Following Lin et al.\\n(2021)weuseGPT-3-basedmetrics,whichhavebeenshowntohaverobustperformanceinpredictinghuman\\njudgments. Specifically, a fine-tuned GPT-3 model¶¶, i.e. a “GPT-judge”, is used to predict the truthfulness\\nand informativeness of the generated outputs from LLMs. For the QA prompt, we adopt a few-shot prompt\\ncontaining 6 random QA pairs with the formats following InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). We report the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative, as well as the percentage that are either\\ntruthful or informative.\\nToxicity. Tomeasurethedegreeofgenerationoftoxiclanguageandhatespeechacrossdifferentgroups, we\\nuseToxiGen(Hartvigsenetal.,2022),adatasetthatcontainsimplicitlytoxicandbenignsentencesmentioning\\n13 minority groups. We adopt a revised version of the dataset from Hosseini et al. (2023) that reduces noise\\nby filtering out prompts for which annotators disagree on the target demographic group. We then use the\\ndefault ToxiGen classifier tuned on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) to measure the toxicity of generations of each\\nof the LLMs.\\nBias. To study the sentiment in model generations that may vary with demographic attributes, we choose\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021), a large-scale bias benchmark that comprises 23,679 English Wikipedia prompts\\nspanning five domains of race, gender, religion, political ideology, and profession, with 43 different sub-\\ngroups∗∗∗. We conduct a sentiment analysis using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner\\n(VADER)(HuttoandGilbert,2014)toevaluatethesentimentsconveyedbythecombinationofpromptprefix\\nand model generation. VADER produces a sentiment score between -1 and 1. A positive (negative) score\\nindicatesapositive(negative)sentimenttowardsthepopulationmentionedintheprompt, andascorecloser\\nto 0 indicates a neutral sentiment.\\nA.4.8 Automatic Safety Benchmark Evaluation Results\\nFine-grained Analysis of Toxicity, Truthfulness, and Bias.Here we perform in-depth analyses to better\\nunderstand the safety of model generations from the perspectives of toxicity, truthfulness, and bias.\\n• Truthfulness. Table 44 presents evaluation results of TruthfulQA for the percentage of truthfulness,\\npercentage of informativeness, and percentage of both truthfulness and informativeness across\\ngenerations. Most of the models show a >90% informativeness in the model generations. However,\\nthe truthfulness percentage is relatively low for pretrained models, around 30% to 40% for Falcon,\\nMPT, and the 7BLlama 1. This percentage increases for pretrainedLlama 1and Llama 2with a\\nlarger size. After instruction fine-tuning, both 7B and 13BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 20% in\\ntruthfulness, 30BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 24%, and 70BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 14%\\ncompared to their pretrained versions.\\n• Toxicity.Table 45 shows that Mexicans, Latinos, and women tend to be the top three demographic\\ngroups with the highest percentages of toxic generations given ToxiGen prompts for the pretrained\\nmodels. Thanks to instruction fine-tuning, fine-tunedLlama 2-Chatmodels of all sizes show an\\neffectively zero percentage of toxic model generations, and hence their results are not presented here.\\n• Bias. Tables 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 present the distribution of sentiment scores across different\\ndemographic groups under the domains of race, gender, religious ideology, political ideology, and\\nprofession. Overall, we observe positive sentiment scores for each domain in the BOLD dataset for\\n¶¶curie:ft-personal-2023-06-01-06-02-42 isusedfor“truthful\",and curie:ft-personal-2023-06-01-05-20-23\\nis used for “informative\".\\n∗∗∗In this analysis, we remove prompts that fall into the religious ideology subgroups Hinduism and Atheism, because\\nthey are underrepresented with only 12 and 29 prompts, respectively.\\n69'),\n",

Promote or enable dangerous behaviors to the user or other people.\\n3. Contain, promote or enable offensive and abusive behavior towards the user or other people.\\n4. Contain, promote or enable sexually explicit content.\\nA.5.3 Quality Assurance Process\\nWehaveimplementedaqualityassuranceprocesstoensureweonlyusehighqualityannotationsfortraining\\nthe model. For this process, a team of highly skilled content managers manually reviewed the annotations\\nand approved the ones that would be used.\\nDuring the quality assurance step, reviewers were asked to only approve those annotations that matched our\\nguidelines: (a) they are consistent with the dialogue history, (b) follow instructions in the prompt (c) are\\nfree of grammatical, spelling and other writing errors, and (d) do not fall into any of the categories described\\nin Section A.5.2. If an annotation needed small changes to be approved, due to grammar or spelling mistakes,\\nor to improve the structure, cohesiveness and style of the text, reviewers could edit it to fix the issues and\\napprove it. If the answer could not be approved without major changes, the reviewers were asked to reject it\\nand write the feedback necessary to improve it.\\nA.5.4 Annotator Selection\\nTo select the annotators who could work on our different data collection tasks, we conducted a multi-step\\nassessment process where we tested their understanding of our guidelines, the alignment with our quality\\nassessment criteria, the alignment with our sensitive topics guidelines and their reading and writing skills.\\nThe process included 4 tests:\\n• Thefirsttestconsistsof3sectionsoftestingtoevaluategrammar,readingcomprehensionandwriting\\nstyle.

To pass the test, annotators\\nneeded to agree with our criteria on 80% of the answers, and pass the written examples with a score\\nof 4 out of 5.\\n74'),\n",

This was a deliberately\\nconservative approach in order to produce a “clean” subset of the data with high precision, and is used in\\nopen-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).\\nThis approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,\\nand didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery\\net al. (2022), some datasets (such as BoolQ) contain contexts extracted verbatim from the web, but not the\\nquestion and answer continuation. As such, highly contaminated samples from these datasets are unlikely\\nto gain an unfair advantage. The methodology in Chowdhery et al. (2022) further improves on the earlier\\nn-gram collision detection by considering a sample to be contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at\\nleast once in the training data.\\nThe previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don’t appear to\\nconsider the formatting of prompts used for actual evaluation. In contrast, we instead match on tokenized\\ninput, being careful to pass fully verbalized evaluation samples to the tokenizer. We also diverge from the\\nprevious methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token\\nto be contaminated if it appears in any tokenn-gram longer than 10 tokens in both the evaluation sample\\nand the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a sample to be the percentage of tokens\\ncontaminated. Thisallowsustoviewthebenchmarkperformanceofourmodelsonarangeofcontamination\\nscales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with< 20% contamination)\\nand a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with> 80% contamination). In order to account for the\\nvagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens, so\\nthat matched spans between an evaluation sample and the training data can differ in at most four positions\\n(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).\\nWe identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee\\net al. (2022), modified to work on a PySpark cluster (effectively without random access to disk). Given the\\nembarrassingly parallel nature of the task, we are able to find all such 10-grams (and their full lengths) in\\nour entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.\\nAs there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has\\ncontributed to evaluation performance (mostly stemming from the fact that \"clean\" and \"dirty\" subsets do\\nnot necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In the event\\nof dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the \"cleanest\" examples to\\nhave an overallworseaverage score than their complement, and the \"dirtiest\" samples to have an overallbetter\\naverage score than their complement. It is insufficient evidence for contamination if only one of these were\\ntrue. To this end, we define four (non-disjoint) subset types as follows:\\n• “Clean”samples, with less than 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not clean”samples, with greater than (or equal to) 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not dirty”samples, with less than 80% token contamination,\\n• “Dirty” samples, with greater than (or equal to) 80% token contamination.\\nThere is an additional confounding factor that we attempt to address directly. With the given definition of\\ncontamination (as well as other definitions mentioned in the literature), there is a possibility that a sample\\n75'),\n",

With the ever increasing amounts of data becoming\\navailable there is good reason to believe that smart data analysis will become\\neven more pervasive as a necessary ingredient for technological progress.\\nThe purpose of this chapter is to provide the reader with an overview over\\nthe vast range of applications which have at their heart a machine learning\\nproblem and to bring some degree of order to the zoo of problems. After\\nthat, we will discuss some basic tools from statistics and probability theory,\\nsince they form the language in which many machine learning problems must\\nbe phrased to become amenable to solving. Finally, we will outline a set of\\nfairly basic yet eﬀective algorithms to solve an important problem, namely\\nthat of classiﬁcation. More sophisticated tools, a discussion of more general\\nproblems and a detailed analysis will follow in later parts of the book.\\n1.1 A Taste of Machine Learning\\nMachine learning can appear in many guises. We now discuss a number of\\napplications, the types of data they deal with, and ﬁnally, we formalize the\\nproblems in a somewhat more stylized fashion. The latter is key if we want to\\navoid reinventing the wheel for every new application. Instead, much of the\\nart of machine learning is to reduce a range of fairly disparate problems to\\na set of fairly narrow prototypes. Much of the science of machine learning is\\nthen to solve those problems and provide good guarantees for the solutions.\\n1.1.1 Applications\\nMost readers will be familiar with the concept of web page ranking. That\\nis, the process of submitting a query to a search engine, which then ﬁnds\\nwebpages relevant to the query and which returns them in their order of\\nrelevance. See e.g. Figure 1.1 for an example of the query results for “ma-\\nchine learning”. That is, the search engine returns a sorted list of webpages\\ngiven a query. To achieve this goal, a search engine needs to ‘know’ which\\n3'),\n",

The 5 top scoring webpages for the query “machine learning”\\npages are relevant and which pages match the query. Such knowledge can be\\ngained from several sources: the link structure of webpages, their content,\\nthe frequency with which users will follow the suggested links in a query, or\\nfrom examples of queries in combination with manually ranked webpages.\\nIncreasingly machine learning rather than guesswork and clever engineering\\nis used to automate the process of designing a good search engine [RPB06].\\nA rather related application is collaborative ﬁltering. Internet book-\\nstores such as Amazon, or video rental sites such as Netﬂix use this informa-\\ntion extensively to entice users to purchase additional goods (or rent more\\nmovies). The problem is quite similar to the one of web page ranking. As\\nbefore, we want to obtain a sorted list (in this case of articles). The key dif-\\nference is that an explicit query is missing and instead we can only use past\\npurchase and viewing decisions of the user to predict future viewing and\\npurchase habits. The key side information here are the decisions made by\\nsimilar users, hence the collaborative nature of the process. See Figure 1.2\\nfor an example. It is clearly desirable to have an automatic system to solve\\nthis problem, thereby avoiding guesswork and time [BK07].\\nAn equally ill-deﬁned problem is that of automatic translation of doc-\\numents. At one extreme, we could aim at fully understanding a text before\\ntranslating it using a curated set of rules crafted by a computational linguist\\nwell versed in the two languages we would like to translate. This is a rather\\narduous task, in particular given that text is not always grammatically cor-\\nrect, nor is the document understanding part itself a trivial one. Instead, we\\ncould simply use examples of translated documents, such as the proceedings\\nof the Canadian parliament or other multilingual entities (United Nations,\\nEuropean Union, Switzerland) to learn how to translate between the two\"),\n",

In other words, we could use examples of translations to learn\\nhow to translate. This machine learning approach proved quite successful\\n[?].\\nMany security applications, e.g. for access control, use face recognition as\\none of its components. That is, given the photo (or video recording) of a\\nperson, recognize who this person is. In other words, the system needs to\\nclassify the faces into one of many categories (Alice, Bob, Charlie, . . . ) or\\ndecide that it is an unknown face. A similar, yet conceptually quite diﬀerent\\nproblem is that of veriﬁcation. Here the goal is to verify whether the person\\nin question is who he claims to be. Note that diﬀerently to before, this\\nis now a yes/no question. To deal with diﬀerent lighting conditions, facial\\nexpressions, whether a person is wearing glasses, hairstyle, etc., it is desirable\\nto have a system which learns which features are relevant for identifying a\\nperson.\\nAnother application where learning helps is the problem ofnamed entity\\nrecognition (see Figure 1.4). That is, the problem of identifying entities,\\nsuch as places, titles, names, actions, etc. from documents. Such steps are\\ncrucial in the automatic digestion and understanding of documents. Some\\nmodern e-mail clients, such as Apple’s Mail.app nowadays ship with the\\nability to identify addresses in mails and ﬁling them automatically in an\\naddress book. While systems using hand-crafted rules can lead to satisfac-\\ntory results, it is far more eﬃcient to use examples of marked-up documents\\nto learn such dependencies automatically, in particular if we want to de-\\nploy our system in many languages.

The average college senior typically\\nknows very little about subjects like neural networks, genetic algorithms, or Baysian\\nnetworks, and this book goes a long way in demystifying these subjects in a very\\nclear, concise, and understandable way. Moreover, the first-year grad. student who is\\ninterested in possibly doing research in this field needs more of an overview than to\\ndive deeply into \\none of the many branches which themselves have had entire books written about\\nthem. This is one of the few if only books where one will find diverse areas of\\nlearning (e.g. analytical, reinforcment, Bayesian, neural-network, genetic-algorithmic)\\nall within the same cover.\\nBut more than just an encyclopedic introduction, the author makes a number of\\nconnections between the different paradigms. For example, he explains that\\nassociated with each paradigm is the notion of an inductive-learning bias, i.e. the\\nunderlying assumptions that lend validity to a given learning approach. These end-of-\\nchapter discussions on bias seem very interesting and unique to this book.\\nFinally, I used this book for part of the reading material for an intro. AI class, and\\nreceived much positive feedback from the students, although some did find the\\npresentation a bit too abstract for their undergraduate tastes\\n Comment | Permalink | Was this review helpful to you?  \\n  (Report this ) \\n 22 of 27 people found the following review helpful:\\n Great compilation, May 18, 2001\\nBy Steven Burns (-) - See all my reviews\\nThis review is from: Machine Learning (Hardcover)\\nThis book is completely worth the price, and worth the hardcover to take care of it.\\nThe main chapters of the book are independent, so you can read them in any order.\\nThe way it explains the different learning approaches is beautiful because: 1)it\\nexplains them nicely 2)it gives examples and 3)it presents pseudocode summaries of\\nthe algorithms.

We will\\ndiscuss means of doing so in an automatic fashion.\\nLists: In some cases the vectors we obtain may contain a variable number\\nof features. For instance, a physician might not necessarily decide to perform\\na full battery of diagnostic tests if the patient appears to be healthy.\\nSets may appear in learning problems whenever there is a large number of\\npotential causes of an eﬀect, which are not well determined. For instance, it is\\nrelatively easy to obtain data concerning the toxicity of mushrooms. It would\\nbe desirable to use such data to infer the toxicity of a new mushroom given\\ninformation about its chemical compounds. However, mushrooms contain a\\ncocktail of compounds out of which one or more may be toxic. Consequently\\nwe need to infer the properties of an object given a set of features, whose\\ncomposition and number may vary considerably.\\nMatrices are a convenient means of representing pairwise relationships.\\nFor instance, in collaborative ﬁltering applications the rows of the matrix\\nmay represent users whereas the columns correspond to products. Only in\\nsome cases we will have knowledge about a given (user, product) combina-\\ntion, such as the rating of the product by a user.\\nA related situation occurs whenever we only have similarity information\\nbetween observations, as implemented by a semi-empirical distance mea-\\nsure. Some homology searches in bioinformatics, e.g. variants of BLAST\\n[AGML90], only return a similarity score which does not necessarily satisfy\\nthe requirements of a metric.\\nImages could be thought of as two dimensional arrays of numbers, that is,\\nmatrices. This representation is very crude, though, since they exhibit spa-\\ntial coherence (lines, shapes) and (natural images exhibit) a multiresolution\\nstructure. That is, downsampling an image leads to an object which has very\\nsimilar statistics to the original image. Computer vision and psychooptics\\nhave created a raft of tools for describing these phenomena.\\nVideo adds a temporal dimension to images. Again, we could represent\\nthem as a three dimensional array. Good algorithms, however, take the tem-\\nporal coherence of the image sequence into account.\\nTrees and Graphs are often used to describe relations between collec-\\ntions of objects. For instance the ontology of webpages of the DMOZ project\\n(www.dmoz.org) has the form of a tree with topics becoming increasingly\\nreﬁned as we traverse from the root to one of the leaves (Arts →Animation\\n→Anime →General Fan Pages →Oﬃcial Sites). In the case of gene ontol-\\nogy the relationships form a directed acyclic graph, also referred to as the\\nGO-DAG [ABB+00].\\nBoth examples above describe estimation problems where our observations'),\n",

For more details and a very gentle and detailed discussion see the\\nexcellent book of [BT03].\\n1.2.1 Random Variables\\nAssume that we cast a dice and we would like to know our chances whether\\nwe would see 1 rather than another digit. If the dice is fair all six outcomes\\nX = {1,..., 6}are equally likely to occur, hence we would see a 1 in roughly\\n1 out of 6 cases. Probability theory allows us to model uncertainty in the out-\\ncome of such experiments. Formally we state that 1 occurs with probability\\n1\\n6 .\\nIn many experiments, such as the roll of a dice, the outcomes are of a\\nnumerical nature and we can handle them easily. In other cases, the outcomes\\nmay not be numerical, e.g., if we toss a coin and observe heads or tails. In\\nthese cases, it is useful to associate numerical values to the outcomes. This\\nis done via a random variable. For instance, we can let a random variable'),\n",

If the random variable is\\ndiscrete, i.e., it takes on a ﬁnite number of values, then this assignment of\\nprobabilities is called a probability mass function or PMF for short. A PMF\\nmust be, by deﬁnition, non-negative and must sum to one. For instance,\\nif the coin is fair, i.e., heads and tails are equally likely, then the random\\nvariable X described above takes on values of +1 and −1 with probability\\n0.5. This can be written as\\nPr(X = +1) = 0.5 and Pr(X = −1) = 0.5. (1.1)\\nWhen there is no danger of confusion we will use the slightly informal no-\\ntation p(x) := Pr(X = x).\\nIn case of a continuous random variable the assignment of probabilities\\nresults in a probability density function or PDF for short. With some abuse\\nof terminology, but keeping in line with convention, we will often use density\\nor distribution instead of probability density function. As in the case of the\\nPMF, a PDF must also be non-negative and integrate to one.

For instance, when measuring the voltage of a device, we\\nmight ask what its typical values might be. When deciding whether to ad-\\nminister a growth hormone to a child a doctor might ask what a sensible\\nrange of height should be. For those purposes we need to deﬁne expectations\\nand related quantities of distributions.\\nDeﬁnition 1.3 (Mean) We deﬁne the mean of a random variable X as\\nE[X] :=\\n∫\\nxdp(x) (1.6)\\nMore generally, if f : R →R is a function, then f(X) is also a random\\nvariable. Its mean is mean given by\\nE[f(X)] :=\\n∫\\nf(x)dp(x). (1.7)\\nWhenever X is a discrete random variable the integral in (1.6) can be re-\\nplaced by a summation:\\nE[X] =\\n∑\\nx\\nxp(x). (1.8)\\nFor instance, in the case of a dice we have equal probabilities of 1 /6 for all\\n6 possible outcomes. It is easy to see that this translates into a mean of\\n(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)/6 = 3.5.\\nThe mean of a random variable is useful in assessing expected losses and\\nbeneﬁts. For instance, as a stock broker we might be interested in the ex-\\npected value of our investment in a year’s time. In addition to that, however,\\nwe also might want to investigate the risk of our investment.

(1.10)\\nThe variance measures by how much on average f(X) deviates from its ex-\\npected value. As we shall see in Section 2.1, an upper bound on the variance\\ncan be used to give guarantees on the probability that f(X) will be within\\nϵ of its expected value. This is one of the reasons why the variance is often\\nassociated with the risk of a random variable. Note that often one discusses\\nproperties of a random variable in terms of its standard deviation, which is\\ndeﬁned as the square root of the variance.\\n1.2.4 Marginalization, Independence, Conditioning, and Bayes\\nRule\\nGiven two random variables X and Y, one can write their joint density\\np(x,y). Given the joint density, one can recover p(x) by integrating out y.\\nThis operation is called marginalization:\\np(x) =\\n∫\\ny\\ndp(x,y).

Moreover,\\nassume that 0.15% of the population is infected.\\nNow assume that the patient has the test carried out and the test re-\\nturns ’HIV-negative’. In this case, logic implies that he is healthy, since the\\ntest has 100% detection rate. In the converse case things are not quite as\\nstraightforward. Denote by X and T the random variables associated with\\nthe health status of the patient and the outcome of the test respectively. We\\nare interested in p(X = HIV+|T = HIV+). By Bayes rule we may write\\np(X = HIV+|T = HIV+) = p(T = HIV+|X = HIV+)p(X = HIV+)\\np(T = HIV+)\\nWhile we know all terms in the numerator, p(T = HIV+) itself is unknown.\\nThat said, it can be computed via\\np(T = HIV+) =\\n∑\\nx∈{HIV+,HIV-}\\np(T = HIV+,x)\\n=\\n∑\\nx∈{HIV+,HIV-}\\np(T = HIV+|x)p(x)\\n= 1.0 ·0.0015 + 0.01 ·0.9985.\\nSubstituting back into the conditional expression yields\\np(X = HIV+|T = HIV+) = 1.0 ·0.0015\\n1.0 ·0.0015 + 0.01 ·0.9985 = 0.1306.\\nIn other words, even though our test is quite reliable, there is such a low\\nprior probability of having been infected with AIDS that there is not much\\nevidence to accept the hypothesis even after this test.'),\n",

A graphical description of our HIV testing scenario. Knowing the age of\\nthe patient inﬂuences our prior on whether the patient is HIV positive (the random\\nvariable X). The outcomes of the tests 1 and 2 are independent of each other given\\nthe status X. We observe the shaded random variables (age, test 1, test 2) and\\nwould like to infer the un-shaded random variable X. This is a special case of a\\ngraphical model which we will discuss in Chapter ??.\\nLet us now think how we could improve the diagnosis. One way is to ob-\\ntain further information about the patient and to use this in the diagnosis.\\nFor instance, information about his age is quite useful. Suppose the patient\\nis 35 years old. In this case we would want to compute p(X = HIV+|T =\\nHIV+,A = 35) where the random variable A denotes the age. The corre-\\nsponding expression yields:\\np(T = HIV+|X = HIV+,A)p(X = HIV+|A)\\np(T = HIV+|A)\\nHere we simply conditioned all random variables on Ain order to take addi-\\ntional information into account. We may assume that the test isindependent\\nof the age of the patient, i.e.\\np(t|x,a) = p(t|x).\\nWhat remains therefore is p(X = HIV+|A). Recent US census data pegs this\\nnumber at approximately 0.9%. Plugging all data back into the conditional\\nexpression yields 1·0.009\\n1·0.009+0.01·0.991 = 0.48. What has happened here is that\\nby including additional observed random variables our estimate has become\\nmore reliable. Combination of evidence is a powerful tool. In our case it\\nhelped us make the classiﬁcation problem of whether the patient is HIV-\\npositive or not more reliable.\\nA second tool in our arsenal is the use of multiple measurements. After\\nthe ﬁrst test the physician is likely to carry out a second test to conﬁrm the\\ndiagnosis. We denote by T1 and T2 (and t1,t2 respectively) the two tests.\\nObviously, what we want is that T2 will give us an “independent” second\\nopinion of the situation. In other words, we want to ensure that T2 does\\nnot make the same mistakes as T1. For instance, it is probably a bad idea\\nto repeat T1 without changes, since it might perform the same diagnostic'),\n",

What we want is that the diagnosis of T2 is independent\\nof that of T2 given the health status X of the patient. This is expressed as\\np(t1,t2|x) = p(t1|x)p(t2|x). (1.16)\\nSee Figure 1.13 for a graphical illustration of the setting. Random variables\\nsatisfying the condition (1.16) are commonly referred to as conditionally\\nindependent. In shorthand we writeT1,T2 ⊥ ⊥X. For the sake of the argument\\nwe assume that the statistics for T2 are given by\\np(t2|x) x= HIV- x= HIV+\\nt2 = HIV- 0.95 0.01\\nt2 = HIV+ 0.05 0.99\\nClearly this test is less reliable than the ﬁrst one. However, we may now\\ncombine both estimates to obtain a very reliable estimate based on the\\ncombination of both events. For instance, for t1 = t2 = HIV+ we have\\np(X = HIV+|T1 = HIV+,T2 = HIV+) = 1.0 ·0.99 ·0.009\\n1.0 ·0.99 ·0.009 + 0.01 ·0.05 ·0.991 = 0.95.\\nIn other words, by combining two tests we can now conﬁrm with very high\\nconﬁdence that the patient is indeed diseased. What we have carried out is a\\ncombination of evidence. Strong experimental evidence of two positive tests\\neﬀectively overcame an initially very strong prior which suggested that the\\npatient might be healthy.\\nTests such as in the example we just discussed are fairly common. For\\ninstance, we might need to decide which manufacturing procedure is prefer-\\nable, which choice of parameters will give better results in a regression es-\\ntimator, or whether to administer a certain drug. Note that often our tests\\nmay not be conditionally independent and we would need to take this into\\naccount.\\n1.3 Basic Algorithms\\nWe conclude our introduction to machine learning by discussing four simple\\nalgorithms, namely Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbors, the Mean Classiﬁer,\\nand the Perceptron, which can be used to solve a binary classiﬁcation prob-\\nlem such as that described in Figure 1.5. We will also introduce the K-means\\nalgorithm which can be employed when labeled data is not available. All\\nthese algorithms are readily usable and easily implemented from scratch in\\ntheir most basic form.\\nFor the sake of concreteness assume that we are interested in spam ﬁlter-\\ning. That is, we are given a set ofme-mails xi, denoted byX := {x1,...,x m}'),\n",

In the context of spam ﬁltering the actual\\ntext of the e-mail x corresponds to the test and the label y is equivalent to\\nthe diagnosis. Recall Bayes Rule (1.15). We could use the latter to infer\\np(y|x) = p(x|y)p(y)\\np(x) .\\nWe may have a good estimate of p(y), that is, the probability of receiving\\na spam or ham mail. Denote by mham and mspam the number of ham and\\nspam e-mails in X. In this case we can estimate\\np(ham) ≈mham\\nm and p(spam) ≈mspam\\nm .\\nThe key problem, however, is that we do not know p(x|y) or p(x). We may\\ndispose of the requirement of knowing p(x) by settling for a likelihood ratio\\nL(x) := p(spam|x)\\np(ham|x) = p(x|spam)p(spam)\\np(x|ham)p(ham) . (1.17)\\nWhenever L(x) exceeds a given threshold c we decide that x is spam and\\nconsequently reject the e-mail. Ifcis large then our algorithm is conservative\\nand classiﬁes an email as spam only if p(spam|x) ≫p(ham|x). On the other\\nhand, if cis small then the algorithm aggressively classiﬁes emails as spam.\\nThe key obstacle is that we have no access top(x|y). This is where we make\\nour key approximation. Recall Figure 1.13. In order to model the distribution\\nof the test outcomes T1 and T2 we made the assumption that they are\\nconditionally independent of each other given the diagnosis. Analogously,\\nwe may now treat the occurrence of each word in a document as a separate\\ntest and combine the outcomes in a naive fashion by assuming that\\np(x|y) =\\n# of words in x∏\\nj=1\\np(wj|y), (1.18)\\nwhere wj denotes the j-th word in document x. This amounts to the as-\\nsumption that the probability of occurrence of a word in a document is\\nindependent of all other words given the category of the document. Even\\nthough this assumption does not hold in general – for instance, the word\\n“York” is much more likely to after the word “New” – it suﬃces for our\\npurposes (see Figure 1.16).\\nThis assumption reduces the diﬃculty of knowing p(x|y) to that of esti-\\nmating the probabilities of occurrence of individual words w.

Secondly, since we are computing a product over\\na large number of factors the numbers might lead to numerical overﬂow or\\nunderﬂow. This can be addressed by summing over the logarithm of terms\\nrather than computing products. Thirdly, we need to address the issue of\\nestimating p(w|y) for words w which we might not have seen before. One\\nway of dealing with this is to increment all counts by 1. This method is\\ncommonly referred to as Laplace smoothing. We will encounter a theoretical\\njustiﬁcation for this heuristic in Section 2.3.\\nThis simple algorithm is known to perform surprisingly well, and variants\\nof it can be found in most modern spam ﬁlters.

The feature map φ maps observations x from X into a feature space H.\\nThe map φ is a convenient way of encoding pre-processing steps systematically.\\nAnalogous expressions can be computed for µ−. Consequently we may ex-\\npress the classiﬁcation rule (1.21) as\\nf(x) =\\nm∑\\ni=1\\nαi⟨xi,x⟩+ b (1.22)\\nwhere b= m−2\\n−\\n∑\\nyi=yj=−1 ⟨xi,xj⟩−m−2\\n+\\n∑\\nyi=yj=1 ⟨xi,xj⟩and αi = yi/myi.\\nThis oﬀers a number of interesting extensions. Recall that when dealing\\nwith documents we needed to perform pre-processing to map e-mails into a\\nvector space. In general, we may pick arbitrary maps φ : X →H mapping\\nthe space of observations into a feature space H, as long as the latter is\\nendowed with a dot product (see Figure 1.21). This means that instead of\\ndealing with ⟨x,x′⟩we will be dealing with ⟨φ(x),φ(x′)⟩.\\nAs we will see in Chapter 6, wheneverH is a so-called Reproducing Kernel\\nHilbert Space, the inner product can be abbreviated in the form of a kernel\\nfunction k(x,x′) which satisﬁes\\nk(x,x′) :=\\n⟨\\nφ(x),φ(x′)\\n⟩\\n. (1.23)\\nThis small modiﬁcation leads to a number of very powerful algorithm and\\nit is at the foundation of an area of research called kernel methods. We\\nwill encounter a number of such algorithms for regression, classiﬁcation,\\nsegmentation, and density estimation over the course of the book. Examples\\nof suitable k are the polynomial kernel k(x,x′) = ⟨x,x′⟩d for d∈N and the\\nGaussian RBF kernel k(x,x′) = e−γ∥x−x′∥2\\nfor γ >0.\\nThe upshot of (1.23) is that our basic algorithm can be kernelized. That\\nis, we may rewrite (1.21) as\\nf(x) =\\nm∑\\ni=1\\nαik(xi,x) + b (1.24)\\nwhere as before αi = yi/myi and the oﬀset b is computed analogously. As'),\n",

In real life, such a set might be diﬃcult\\nto obtain all at once. Instead, a user might want to haveinstant results when-\\never a new e-mail arrives and he would like the system to learn immediately\\nfrom any corrections to mistakes the system makes.\\nTo overcome both these diﬃculties one could envisage working with the\\nfollowing protocol: As emails arrive our algorithm classiﬁes them as spam or\\nnon-spam, and the user provides feedback as to whether the classiﬁcation is\\ncorrect or incorrect. This feedback is then used to improve the performance\\nof the classiﬁer over a period of time.\\nThis intuition can be formalized as follows: Our classiﬁer maintains a\\nparameter vector. At the t-th time instance it receives a data point xt, to\\nwhich it assigns a label ˆyt using its current parameter vector. The true label\\nyt is then revealed, and used to update the parameter vector of the classiﬁer.\\nSuch algorithms are said to be online. We will now describe perhaps the\\nsimplest classiﬁer of this kind namely the Perceptron [Heb49, Ros58].\\nLet us assume that the data points xt ∈Rd, and labels yt ∈{±1}.

The rate of\\nconvergence however depends on the margin. Roughly speaking, the margin\\nquantiﬁes how linearly separable a dataset is, and hence how easy it is to\\nsolve a given classiﬁcation problem.\\nDeﬁnition 1.6 (Margin) Let w ∈Rd be a weight vector and let b∈R be\\nan oﬀset. The margin of an observation x∈Rd with associated label y is\\nγ(x,y) := y(⟨w,x⟩+ b) . (1.27)\\nMoreover, the margin of an entire set of observations X with labels Y is\\nγ(X,Y) := min\\ni\\nγ(xi,yi). (1.28)\\nGeometrically speaking (see Figure 1.22) the margin measures the distance\\nof xfrom the hyperplane deﬁned by {x|⟨w,x⟩+ b= 0}. Larger the margin,\\nthe more well separated the data and hence easier it is to ﬁnd a hyperplane\\nwith correctly classiﬁes the dataset. The following theorem asserts that if\\nthere exists a linear classiﬁer which can classify a dataset with a large mar-\\ngin, then the Perceptron will also correctly classify the same dataset after\\nmaking a small number of mistakes.\\nTheorem 1.7 (Novikoﬀ’s theorem) Let (X,Y) be a dataset with at least\\none example labeled +1 and one example labeled −1. Let R:= maxt∥xt∥, and\\nassume that there exists (w∗,b∗) such that ∥w∗∥= 1 and γt := yt(⟨w∗,xt⟩+\\nb∗) ≥γ for all t. Then, the Perceptron will make at most (1+R2)(1+(b∗)2)\\nγ2\\nmistakes.\\nThis result is remarkable since it does not depend on the dimensionality\\nof the problem. Instead, it only depends on the geometry of the setting,\\nas quantiﬁed via the margin γ and the radius R of a ball enclosing the\\nobservations. Interestingly, a similar bound can be shown for Support Vector\\nMachines [Vap95] which we will be discussing in Chapter 7.\\nProof We can safely ignore the iterations where no mistakes were made\\nand hence no updates were carried out. Therefore, without loss of generality\\nassume that the t-th update was made after seeing the t-th observation and\\nlet wt denote the weight vector after the update. Furthermore, for simplicity\\nassume that the algorithm started with w0 = 0 and b0 = 0.

Instead of increasing the\\nnumber of nodes we will investigate what happens when increasing the com-\\nplexity of the feature map φ and its associated kernel k. The advantage of\\ndoing so is that we will reap the beneﬁts from convex analysis and linear\\nmodels, possibly at the expense of a slightly more costly function evaluation.\\n1.3.5 K-Means\\nAll the algorithms we discussed so far are supervised, that is, they assume\\nthat labeled training data is available. In many applications this is too much\\nto hope for; labeling may be expensive, error prone, or sometimes impossi-\\nble. For instance, it is very easy to crawl and collect every page within the\\nwww.purdue.edu domain, but rather time consuming to assign a topic to\\neach page based on its contents. In such cases, one has to resort to unsuper-\\nvised learning. A prototypical unsupervised learning algorithm is K-means,\\nwhich is clustering algorithm.

This is equally true in statistics. For historic rea-\\nsons its applications to distributions is called the characteristic function,\\nwhich we will discuss in this section. At its foundations lie standard tools\\nfrom functional analysis and signal processing [Rud73, Pap62]. We begin by\\nrecalling the basic properties:\\nDeﬁnition 2.6 (Fourier Transform) Denote by f : Rn →C a function\\ndeﬁned on a d-dimensional Euclidean space. Moreover, let x,ω ∈Rn. Then\\nthe Fourier transform F and its inverse F−1 are given by\\nF[f](ω) := (2π)−d\\n2\\n∫\\nRn\\nf(x) exp(−i⟨ω,x⟩)dx (2.7)\\nF−1[g](x) := (2π)−d\\n2\\n∫\\nRn\\ng(ω) exp(i⟨ω,x⟩)dω. (2.8)\\nThe key insight is that F−1 ◦F = F ◦F−1 = Id. In other words, F and\\nF−1 are inverses to each other for all functions which are L2 integrable on\\nRd, which includes probability distributions. One of the key advantages of\\nFourier transforms is that derivatives and convolutions on f translate into\\nmultiplications. That is F[f ◦g] = (2π)\\nd\\n2 F[f] ·F[g]. The same rule applies\\nto the inverse transform, i.e. F−1[f ◦g] = (2π)\\nd\\n2 F−1[f]F−1[g].\\nThe beneﬁt for statistical analysis is that often problems are more easily\\nexpressed in the Fourier domain and it is easier to prove convergence results\\nthere. These results then carry over to the original domain. We will be\\nexploiting this fact in the proof of the law of large numbers and the central\\nlimit theorem. Note that the deﬁnition of Fourier transforms can be extended\\nto more general domains such as groups. See e.g. [BCR84] for further details.'),\n",

The goal is to increase the yield of\\nthe process, that is, the number of chips of the 400 potential chips on the\\nwafer which can be sold. Unfortunately this number is a random variable,\\ni.e. the number of working chips per wafer can vary widely between diﬀerent\\nwafers. Since process ’A’ has been running in the factory for a very long\\ntime we may assume that the yield is well known, say it is µA = 350 out\\nof 400 processors on average. It is our goal to determine whether process\\n’B’ is better and what its yield may be. Obviously, since production runs\\nare expensive we want to be able to determine this number as quickly as\\npossible, i.e. using as few wafers as possible. The production manager is risk\\naverse and wants to ensure that the new process is really better. Hence he\\nrequires a conﬁdence level of 95% before he will change the production.'),\n",

Solving this\\nfor m yields\\nm≥0.5|b−a|2ϵ−2 log(2/δ) ≈737.8 (2.19)\\nIn other words, we need at lest 738 wafers to determine whether process ’B’\\nis better.

This leads us to an eﬀective method for non-\\nparametric data analysis, the Watson-Nadaraya estimator [Wat64, Nad65].\\nThe basic idea is very simple: assume that we have a binary classiﬁcation\\nproblem, i.e. we need to distinguish between two classes.

After all, we only need to compute sums. The downside, similar\\nto that of the k-nearest neighbor classiﬁer is that it may require sums (or\\nsearch) over a large number of observations. That is, evaluation of (2.38) is\\npotentially an O(m) operation. Fast tree based representations can be used\\nto accelerate this [BKL06, KM00], however their behavior depends signiﬁ-\\ncantly on the dimensionality of the data. We will encounter computationally\\nmore attractive methods at a later stage.\\nFor binary classiﬁcation (2.38) can be simpliﬁed considerably. Assume\\nthat y∈{±1}. For p(y= 1|x) >0.5 we will choose that we should estimate\\ny = 1 and in the converse case we would estimate y = −1.

Instead of drawing a hard boundary at thekclosest\\nobservation we use a soft weighting scheme with weights wi(x) depending\\non which observations are closest.\\nNote furthermore that the numerator of (2.39) is very similar to the simple\\nclassiﬁer of Section 1.3.3. In fact, for kernels k(x,x′) such as the Gaussian\\nRBF kernel, which are also kernels in the sense of a Parzen windows den-\\nsity estimate, i.e. k(x,x′) = r−dh\\n(\\nx−x′\\nr\\n)\\nthe two terms are identical.

For instance, in the context of exponential families, we may want\\nto estimate a parameter ˆθ such that it is close to the “true” parameter θ∗\\nin the distribution. While the problem is fully general, we will describe the\\nrelevant steps in obtaining estimates for the special case of the exponential\\nfamily. This is done for two reasons — ﬁrstly, exponential families are an\\nimportant special case and we will encounter slightly more complex variants\\non the reasoning in later chapters of the book. Secondly, they are of a suﬃ-\\nciently simple form that we are able to show a range of diﬀerent techniques.\\nIn more advanced applications only a small subset of those methods may be\\npractically feasible. Hence exponential families provide us with a working\\nexample based on which we can compare the consequences of a number of\\ndiﬀerent techniques.\\n2.4.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimation\\nWhenever we have a distribution p(x; θ) parametrized by some parameter\\nθ we may use data to ﬁnd a value of θ which maximizes the likelihood that\\nthe data would have been generated by a distribution with this choice of\\nparameter.\\nFor instance, assume that we observe a set of temperature measurements\\nX = {x1,...,x m}. In this case, we could try ﬁnding a normal distribution\\nsuch that the likelihoodp(X; θ) of the data under the assumption of a normal\\ndistribution is maximized. Note that this does not imply in any way that the\\ntemperature measurements are actually drawn from a normal distribution.\\nInstead, it means that we are attempting to ﬁnd the Gaussian which ﬁts the\\ndata in the best fashion.\\nWhile this distinction may appear subtle, it is critical: we do not assume\\nthat our model accurately reﬂects reality. Instead, we simply try doing the\\nbest possible job at modeling the data given a speciﬁed model class. Later\\nwe will encounter alternative approaches at estimation, namely Bayesian\\nmethods, which make the assumption that our model ought to be able to\\ndescribe the data accurately.\\nDeﬁnition 2.16 (Maximum Likelihood Estimator) For a modelp(·; θ)\\nparametrized by θ and observations X the maximum likelihood estimator\\n(MLE) is\\nˆθML[X] := argmax\\nθ\\np(X; θ).

This estimator\\nis also referred to as the Maximum a Posteriori, or MAP estimator. It diﬀers\\nfrom the maximum likelihood estimator by adding the negative log-prior\\nto the optimization problem. For this reason it is sometimes also referred\\nto as Penalized MLE. Eﬀectively we are penalizing unlikely choices θ via\\n−log p(θ).\\nNote that using ˆθMAP(X) as the parameter of choice is not quite accurate.\\nAfter all, we can only infer a distribution over θ and in general there is no\\nguarantee that the posterior is indeed concentrated around its mode. A more\\naccurate treatment is to use the distribution p(θ|X) directly via\\np(x|X) =\\n∫\\np(x|θ)p(θ|X)dθ. (2.65)\\nIn other words, we integrate out the unknown parameter θ and obtain the\\ndensity estimate directly. As we will see, it is generally impossible to solve\\n(2.65) exactly, an important exception being conjugate priors.

We will encounter them throughout, the former sometimes in the\\nguise of regularization and Gaussian Processes, the latter in the context of\\nexchangeable models such as the Dirichlet Process.\\nNorm-constrained priors take on the form\\np(θ) ∝exp(−λ∥θ−θ0∥d\\np) for p,d ≥1 and λ> 0. (2.66)\\nThat is, they restrict the deviation of the parameter valueθfrom some guess\\nθ0. The intuition is that extreme values of θ are much less likely than more\\nmoderate choices of θwhich will lead to more smooth and even distributions\\np(x|θ).\\nA popular choice is the Gaussian prior which we obtain for p = d = 1\\nand λ = 1/2σ2. Typically one sets θ0 = 0 in this case. Note that in (2.66)\\nwe did not spell out the normalization of p(θ) — in the context of MAP\\nestimation this is not needed since it simply becomes a constant oﬀset in\\nthe optimization problem (2.64). We have\\nˆθMAP[X] = argmin\\nθ\\nm[g(θ) −⟨θ,µ[X]⟩] + λ∥θ−θ0∥d\\np (2.67)\\nFor d,p ≥1 and λ≥0 the resulting optimization problem is convex and it\\nhas a unique solution. Moreover, very eﬃcient algorithms exist to solve this\\nproblem. We will discuss this in detail in Chapter 3. Figure 2.12 shows the\\nregions of equal prior probability for a range of diﬀerent norm-constrained\\npriors.\\nAs can be seen from the diagram, the choice of the norm can have profound\\nconsequences on the solution. That said, as we will show in Chapter ??, the\\nestimate ˆθMAP is well concentrated and converges to the optimal solution\\nunder fairly general conditions.\\nAn alternative to norm-constrained priors are conjugate priors. They are\\ndesigned such that the posterior p(θ|X) has the same functional form as the\\nprior p(θ). In exponential families such priors are deﬁned via\\np(θ|n,ν) = exp (⟨nν,θ⟩−ng(θ) −h(ν,n)) where (2.68)\\nh(ν,n) = log\\n∫\\nexp (⟨nν,θ⟩−ng(θ)) dθ.

For instance, a linguist might be interested in estimating the fre-\\nquency of words in Shakespeare’s collected works, or one might want to\\ncompare the change with respect to a collection of webpages.

Moreover, denote by p(w|θ) the\\nprobability of occurrence of word w, then under the assumption that the\\nwords are independently drawn, we have\\np(d|θ) =\\nmd∏\\ni=1\\np(wi|θ). (2.71)\\nIt is our goal to ﬁnd parameters θ such that p(d|θ) is accurate. For a given\\ncollection D of documents denote by mw the number of counts for word w\\nin the entire collection. Moreover, denote by m the total number of words\\nin the entire collection. In this case we have\\np(D|θ) =\\n∏\\ni\\np(di|θ) =\\n∏\\nw\\np(w|θ)mw. (2.72)\\nFinding suitable parameters θ given D proceeds as follows: In a maximum\\nlikelihood model we set\\np(w|θ) = mw\\nm . (2.73)\\nIn other words, we use the empirical frequency of occurrence as our best\\nguess and the suﬃcient statistic ofDis φ(w) = ew, where ew denotes the unit\\nvector which is nonzero only for the “coordinate” w.

The probability that this occurs is clearly p(X). Hence the\\nlarger p(X) the higher the eﬃciency of the sampler. See Figure 2.16.\\nExample 2.13 (Uniform distribution on a disc) The procedure works\\ntrivially as follows: draw x,y ∼U[0,1]. Accept if (2x−1)2 + (2y−1)2 ≤1\\nand return sample (2x−1,2y−1).

Therefore, the ﬁrst order conditions are both necessary and suﬃcient\\nwhen minimizing a convex function.\\n3.1.3 Subgradients\\nSo far, we worked with diﬀerentiable convex functions. The subgradient is a\\ngeneralization of gradients appropriate for convex functions, including those\\nwhich are not necessarily smooth.\\nDeﬁnition 3.7 (Subgradient) Suppose x is a point where a convex func-\\ntion f is ﬁnite. Then a subgradient is the normal vector of any tangential\\nsupporting hyperplane of f at x. Formally µ is called a subgradient of f at\\nx if, and only if,\\nf(x′) ≥f(x) +\\n⟨\\nx′−x,µ\\n⟩\\nfor all x′. (3.13)\\nThe set of all subgradients at a point is called the subdiﬀerential, and is de-\\nnoted by ∂xf(x). If this set is not empty then f is said to be subdiﬀerentiable\\nat x. On the other hand, if this set is a singleton then, the function is said\\nto be diﬀerentiable at x. In this case we use ∇f(x) to denote the gradient\\nof f. Convex functions are subdiﬀerentiable everywhere in their domain. We\\nnow state some simple rules of subgradient calculus:\\nAddition ∂x(f1(x) + f2(x)) = ∂xf1(x) + ∂xf2(x)\\nScaling ∂xαf(x) = α∂xf(x), for α> 0\\nAﬃne Transform If g(x) = f(Ax+ b) for some matrix A and vector b,\\nthen ∂xg(x) = A⊤∂yf(y).\\nPointwise Maximum If g(x) = max ifi(x) then ∂g(x) = conv(∂xfi′) where\\ni′∈argmaxifi(x).\\nThe deﬁnition of a subgradient can also be understood geometrically. As\\nillustrated by Figure 3.4, a diﬀerentiable convex function is always lower\\nbounded by its ﬁrst order Taylor approximation. This concept can be ex-\\ntended to non-smooth functions via subgradients, as Figure 3.5 shows.\\nBy using more involved concepts, the proof of Lemma 3.6 can be extended\\nto subgradients. In this case, minimizing a convex nonsmooth function en-\\ntails ﬁnding a x such that 0 ∈∂f(x).'),\n",

One can thus change the condition number of the problem by\\nvarying the eigen-spectrum of the matrix A. For instance, if we set A to\\nthe n×n identity matrix, then λmax = λmin = 1 and hence the problem is\\nwell conditioned. In this case, gradient descent converges very quickly to the\\noptimal solution. We illustrate this behavior on a two dimensional quadratic\\nfunction in Figure 3.8 (right).\\nOn the other hand, if we choose A such that λmax ≫ λmin then the\\nproblem (3.48) becomes ill-conditioned.

The\\nclassiﬁcation rule (5.7) in this case specializes as follows: predict +1 when-\\never p(y= +1|x,θ) ≥p(y= −1|x,θ) otherwise predict −1. However\\nlog p(y= +1|x,θ)\\np(y= −1|x,θ) =\\n⣨\\nˆφ(x),θ\\n⟩\\n,\\ntherefore one can equivalently use sign\\n(⣨\\nˆφ(x),θ\\n⟩)\\nas our prediction func-\\ntion.

Broadly speaking, machine learning al-\\ngorithms which rely only on the dot product between instances can be “ker-\\nnelized” by replacing all instances of ⟨x,x′⟩by a kernel function k(x,x′).\\nWe saw examples of such algorithms in Sections 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 and we will\\nsee many more examples in Chapter 7. Arguably, the design of a good ker-\\nnel underlies the success of machine learning in many applications.

In\\nother words, kernels correspond to dot products in some dot product space.\\nThe main advantage of using a kernel as a similarity measure are threefold:\\nFirst, if the feature space is rich enough, then simple estimators such as\\nhyperplanes and half-spaces may be suﬃcient. For instance, to classify the\\npoints in Figure BUGBUG, we need a nonlinear decision boundary, but\\nonce we map the points to a 3 dimensional space a hyperplane suﬃces.\\nSecond, kernels allow us to construct machine learning algorithms in the\\ndot product space H without explicitly computing Φ(x). Third, we need not\\nmake any assumptions about the input space X other than for it to be a\\nset. As we will see later in this chapter, this allows us to compute similarity\\nbetween discrete objects such as strings, trees, and graphs.

Instead of a simple bag of words, one can also map a text to the\\nset of pairs of words that co-occur in a sentence for a richer representation.\\n6.1.1.2 Polynomial Kernel\\nGiven x ∈Rn, we can compute a feature map Φ by taking all the d-th\\norder products (also called the monomials) of the entries of x.

Let x∈X\\nbe a discrete object which can be decomposed into P parts xp ∈Xp in many\\ndiﬀerent ways. As a concrete example consider the string x= abcwhich can\\nbe split into two sets of substrings of size two namely {a,bc}and {ab,c}.\\nWe denote the set of all such decompositions as R(x), and use it to build a\\nkernel on X as follows:\\n[k1 ⋆...⋆k P] (x,x′) =\\n∑\\n¯x∈R(x),¯x′∈R(x′)\\nP∏\\np=1\\nkp(¯xp,¯x′\\np). (6.4)\\nHere, the sum is over all possible ways in which we can decompose x and\\nx′ into ¯x1,..., ¯xP and ¯x′\\n1,..., ¯x′\\nP respectively. If the cardinality of R(x) is\\nﬁnite, then it can be shown that (6.4) results in a valid kernel. Although\\nconvolution kernels provide the abstract framework, speciﬁc instantiations\\nof this idea lead to a rich set of kernels on discrete objects. We will now\\ndiscuss some of them in detail.\\n6.1.1.5 String Kernels\\nThe basic idea behind string kernels is simple: Compare the strings by\\nmeans of the subsequences they contain.

First, kernels on graphs\\nare used to compare nodes of a single graph. In contrast, kernels between\\ngraphs focus on comparing two graphs. A random walk (or its continuous\\ntime limit, diﬀusion) underlie both types of kernels. The basic intuition is\\nthat two nodes are similar if there are a number of paths which connect\\nthem while two graphs are similar if they share many common paths. To\\ndescribe these kernels formally we need to introduce some notation.\\nA graph G consists of an ordered set of n vertices V = {v1,v2,...,v n},\\nand a set of directed edges E ⊂V×V. A vertex vi is said to be a neighbor\\nof another vertex vj if they are connected by an edge, i.e., if (vi,vj) ∈E;\\nthis is also denoted vi ∼vj. The adjacency matrix of a graph is the n×n\\nmatrix A with Aij = 1 if vi ∼vj, and 0 otherwise. A walk of length k on G\\nis a sequence of indices i0,i1,...i k such that vir−1 ∼vir for all 1 ≤r≤k.\\nThe adjacency matrix has a normalized cousin, deﬁned ˜A:= D−1A, which\\nhas the property that each of its rows sums to one, and it can therefore\\nserve as the transition matrix for a stochastic process. Here, D is a diag-\\nonal matrix of node degrees, i.e., Dii = di = ∑\\nj Aij. A random walk on\\nG is a process generating sequences of vertices vi1 ,vi2 ,vi3 ,... according to\\nP(ik+1|i1,...i k) = ˜Aik,ik+1 . The tth power of ˜Athus describes t-length walks,\\ni.e., ( ˜At)ij is the probability of a transition from vertex vj to vertex vi via\\na walk of length t (problem BUGBUG). If p0 is an initial probability dis-\\ntribution over vertices, then the probability distribution pt describing the\\nlocation of our random walker at time tis pt = ˜Atp0. The jth component of\\npt denotes the probability of ﬁnishing at-length walk at vertex vj. A random\\nwalk need not continue indeﬁnitely; to model this, we associate every node\\nvik in the graph with a stopping probability qik. The overall probability of\\nstopping after t steps is given by q⊤pt.\\nGiven two graphs G(V,E) and G′(V′,E′), their direct product G× is a\\ngraph with vertex set\\nV× = {(vi,v′\\nr) : vi ∈V, v′\\nr ∈V′}, (6.7)\\nand edge set\\nE× = {((vi,v′\\nr), (vj,v′\\ns)) : ( vi,vj) ∈E ∧(v′\\nr,v′\\ns) ∈E′}. (6.8)\\nIn other words, G× is a graph over pairs of vertices from G and G′, and\\ntwo vertices in G× are neighbors if and only if the corresponding vertices\\nin G and G′are both neighbors; see Figure 6.1 for an illustration. If A and\\nA′ are the respective adjacency matrices of G and G′, then the adjacency'),\n",

Performing a random\\nwalk on the direct product graph is equivalent to performing a simultaneous\\nrandom walk on Gand G′. If pand p′denote initial probability distributions\\nover the vertices of G and G′, then the corresponding initial probability\\ndistribution on the direct product graph is p×:= p⊗p′.

(7.12)\\nWriting (7.5) as (7.12) is particularly revealing because it shows that a\\nsupport vector classiﬁer is nothing but a regularized risk minimizer. Here\\nthe regularizer is the square norm of the decision hyperplane 1\\n2 ∥w∥2, and\\nthe loss function is the so-called binary hinge loss (Figure 7.3):\\nl(w,x,y ) = max(0,1 −y(⟨w,x⟩+ b)). (7.13)\\nIt is easy to verify that the binary hinge loss (7.13) is convex but non-\\ndiﬀerentiable (see Figure 7.3) which renders the overall objective function\\n(7.12) to be convex but non-smooth. There are two diﬀerent strategies to\\nminimize such an objective function. If minimizing (7.12) in the primal, one\\ncan employ non-smooth convex optimizers such as bundle methods (Section\\n3.2.7). This yields a d dimensional problem where d is the dimension of x.\\nOn the other hand, since (7.12) is strongly convex because of the presence\\nof the 1\\n2 ∥w∥2 term, its Fenchel dual has a Lipschitz continuous gradient\\n(see Lemma 3.10). The dual problem is m dimensional and contains linear\\nconstraints. This strategy is particularly attractive when the kernel trick is\\nused or whenever d ≫m. In fact, the dual problem obtained via Fenchel\\nduality is very related to the Quadratic programming problem (7.9) obtained\\nvia Lagrange duality (problem 7.4).\\n7.1.2 An Exponential Family Interpretation\\nOur motivating arguments for deriving the SVM algorithm have largely\\nbeen geometric. We now show that an equally elegant probabilistic interpre-\\ntation also exists. Assuming that the training set {(x1,y1),..., (xm,ym)}\\nwas drawn iid from some underlying distribution, and using the Bayes rule\\n(1.15) one can write the likelihood\\np(θ|X,Y ) ∝p(θ)p(Y|X,θ) = p(θ)\\nm∏\\ni=1\\np(yi|xi,θ), (7.14)'),\n",

This often blurs the similarities as well as subtle diﬀerences\\nbetween them, often for historic reasons: Each new loss is typically accompa-\\nnied by at least one publication dedicated to it. In many cases, the loss is not\\nspelled out explicitly either but instead, it is only given by means of a con-\\nstrained optimization problem. A case in point are the papers introducing\\n(binary) hinge loss [BM92, CV95] and structured loss [TGK04, TJHA05].\\nLikewise, a geometric description obscures the underlying loss function, as\\nin novelty detection [SPST+01].\\nIn this section we give an expository yet unifying presentation of many\\nof those loss functions. Many of them are well known, while others, such\\nas multivariate ranking, hazard regression, or Poisson regression are not\\ncommonly used in machine learning. Tables A3.1 and A3.1 contain a choice\\nsubset of simple scalar and vectorial losses. Our aim is to put the multitude\\nof loss functions in an uniﬁed framework, and to show how these losses\\nand their (sub)gradients can be computed eﬃciently for use in our solver\\nframework.\\nNote that not all losses, while convex, are continuously diﬀerentiable. In\\nthis situation we give a subgradient.

At its core it relies on two\\ntypes of convex loss functions: logistic loss:\\nl(x,y,w ) = log\\n∑\\ny′∈Y\\nexp\\n(⟨\\nw,φ(x,y′)\\n⟩)\\n−⟨w,φ(x,y)⟩, (3.5)\\nand soft-margin loss:\\nl(x,y,w ) = max\\ny′∈Y\\nΓ(y,y′)\\n⟨\\nw,φ(x,y′) −φ(x,y)\\n⟩\\n+ ∆(y,y′). (3.6)\\nHere φ(x,y) is a joint feature map, ∆( y,y′) ≥0 describes the cost of mis-\\nclassifying y by y′, and Γ(y,y′) ≥0 is a scaling term which indicates by how\\nmuch the large margin property should be enforced. For instance, [TGK04]\\nchoose Γ(y,y′) = 1. On the other hand [TJHA05] suggest Γ(y,y′) = ∆(y,y′),\\nwhich reportedly yields better performance. Finally, [McA07] recently sug-\\ngested generic functions Γ( y,y′).\\nThe logistic loss can also be interpreted as the negative log-likelihood of\\na conditional exponential family model:\\np(y|x; w) := exp(⟨w,φ(x,y)⟩−g(w|x)), (3.7)\\nwhere the normalizing constant g(w|x), often called the log-partition func-\\ntion, reads\\ng(w|x) := log\\n∑\\ny′∈Y\\nexp\\n(⟨\\nw,φ(x,y′)\\n⟩)\\n.

We therefore refer the reader to the edited\\nvolume [BHS+07] and the references therein.\\nIf the underlying graphical model is tractable then eﬃcient inference al-\\ngorithms based on dynamic programming can be used to compute (3.5) and\\n(3.6). We discuss intractable graphical models in Section A3.1.2.1, and now\\nturn our attention to the derivatives of the above structured losses.\\nWhen it comes to computing derivatives of the logistic loss, (3.5), we have\\n∂wl(x,y,w ) =\\n∑\\ny′φ(x,y′) exp⟨w,φ(x,y′)⟩∑\\ny′exp ⟨w,φ(x,y′)⟩ −φ(x,y) (3.9)\\n= Ey′∼p(y′|x)\\n[\\nφ(x,y′)\\n]\\n−φ(x,y).

Examples are criteria such as Normalized Discounted\\nCumulative Gain (NDCG) , Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Precision@n, or\\nExpected Rank Utility (ERU). They are used to address the issue of evaluat-\\ning rankers, search engines or recommender sytems [Voo01, JK02, BHK98,\\nBH04]. For instance, in webpage ranking only the ﬁrst k retrieved docu-\\nments that matter, since users are unlikely to look beyond the ﬁrst k, say\\n10, retrieved webpages in an internet search.

In these cases we have a\\nhierarchy of categories to which an element xmay belong. Figure A3.1 gives\\ntwo examples of such directed acyclic graphs (DAG). The ﬁrst example is\\na binary tree, while the second contains nodes with diﬀerent numbers of\\nchildren (e.g., node 4 and 12), nodes at diﬀerent levels having children (e.g.,\\nnodes 5 and 12), and nodes which have more than one parent (e.g., node 5).\\nIt is a well known fundamental property of trees that they have at most as\\nmany internal nodes as they have leaf nodes.\\nIt is now our goal to build a classiﬁer which is able to categorize observa-\\ntions according to which leaf node they belong to (each leaf node is assigned\\na label y). Denote by k+ 1 the number of nodes in the DAG including the\\nroot node. In this case we may design a feature map φ(y) ∈Rk [CH04] by\\nassociating with every label y the vector describing the path from the root\\nnode to y, ignoring the root node itself. For instance, for the ﬁrst DAG in\\nFigure A3.1 we have\\nφ(8) = (1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) and φ(13) = (0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0)\\nWhenever several paths are admissible, as in the right DAG of Figure A3.1\\nwe average over all possible paths. For example, we have\\nφ(10) = (0.5,0.5,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0) and φ(15) = (0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1).\\nAlso note that the lengths of the paths need not be the same ( e.g., to\\nreach 15 it takes a longer path than to reach 13). Likewise, it is natural to\\nassume that ∆(y,y′), i.e., the cost for mislabeling yas y′will depend on the\\nsimilarity of the path. In other words, it is likely that the cost for placing\\nxinto the wrong sub-sub-category is less than getting the main category of\\nthe object wrong.\\nTo complete the setting, note that for φ(x,y) = φ(y) ⊗x the cost of\\ncomputing all labels is k inner products, since the value of ⟨w,φ(x,y)⟩for a\\nparticular ycan be obtained by the sum of the contributions for the segments\\nof the path. This means that the values for all terms can be computed by\\na simple breadth ﬁrst traversal through the graph. As before, we may make\\nuse of vectorization in our approach, since we may compute xW ∈Rk to\\nobtain the contributions on all segments of the DAG before performing the\\ngraph traversal. Since we have m patterns xi we may vectorize matters by\\npre-computing XW.\\nAlso note that φ(y)−φ(y′) is nonzero only for those edges where the paths\\nfor yand y′diﬀer. Hence we only change weights on those parts of the graph\\nwhere the categorization diﬀers.

They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs,Llama 2and\\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chatmodels generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development ofLlama 2andLlama 2-Chat, such as\\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\\n3'),\n",

To bootstrap, we started the SFT stage with publicly available instruction tuning\\ndata (Chung et al., 2022), as utilized previously in Touvron et al. (2023).\\nQuality Is All You Need.Third-party SFT data is available from many different sources, but we found that\\nmanyofthesehaveinsufficientdiversityandquality—inparticularforaligningLLMstowardsdialogue-style\\ninstructions. As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data,\\nas illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but\\nhigher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved. These\\nfindingsaresimilarinspirittoZhouetal.(2023),whichalsofindsthatalimitedsetofcleaninstruction-tuning\\ndata can be sufficient to reach a high level of quality. We found that SFT annotations in the order of tens of\\nthousands was enough to achieve a high-quality result. We stopped annotating SFT after collecting a total of\\n27,540 annotations. Note that we do not include any Meta user data.\\nWe also observed that different annotation platforms and vendors can result in markedly different down-\\nstream model performance, highlighting the importance of data checks even when using vendors to source\\nannotations. Tovalidateourdataquality,wecarefullyexaminedasetof180examples,comparingtheannota-\\ntions provided by humans with the samples generated by the model through manual scrutiny. Surprisingly,\\nwe found that the outputs sampled from the resulting SFT model were often competitive with SFT data\\nhandwritten by human annotators, suggesting that we could reprioritize and devote more annotation effort\\nto preference-based annotation for RLHF.\\nFine-Tuning Details. For supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial\\nlearning rate of2 × 10−5, a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.\\nFor the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer. To ensure the model sequence\\nlength is properly filled, we concatenate all the prompts and answers from the training set. A special token is\\nutilized to separate the prompt and answer segments. We utilize an autoregressive objective and zero-out\\nthe loss on tokens from the user prompt, so as a result, we backpropagate only on answer tokens. Finally, we\\nfine-tune the model for 2 epochs.\\n3.2 Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)\\nRLHF is a model training procedure that is applied to a fine-tuned language model to furtheralignmodel\\nbehavior with human preferences and instruction following.

We chose a binary comparison protocol over\\nother schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other\\nstrategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work.\\nOur annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose\\nbetween two sampled model responses, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the\\ntworesponsestoagivenpromptaresampledfromtwodifferentmodelvariants,andvaryingthetemperature\\nhyper-parameter. Inadditiontogivingparticipantsaforcedchoice,wealsoaskannotatorstolabelthedegree\\nto which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice issignificantly better, better,\\nslightly better, ornegligibly better/ unsure.\\nFor our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how\\nwell Llama 2-Chatresponses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to\\nwhether Llama 2-Chat’s responses are unsafe, e.g.,“giving detailed instructions on making a bomb”could\\nbe considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to\\napply specific guidelines to each and better guide annotators; for example, our safety annotations provide\\ninstructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.\\nApart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.\\nThis additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response\\nis safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with\\n18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples\\nwhere the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be\\nbetter/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations\\ncan be found in Section 4.2.1.\\nHuman annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our\\nreward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions forLlama 2-Chat(see\\nthe results in Section 5, Figure 20).Llama 2-Chatimprovement also shifted the model’s data distribution.\\nSince reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from\\nhyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), it is important before a newLlama 2-Chattuning iteration to\\ngather new preference data using the latestLlama 2-Chatiterations. This step helps keep the reward model\\non-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.\\nIn Table 6, we report the statistics of reward modeling data that we collected over time, and present them\\nagainst multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al.,\\n2022a), OpenAI Summarize (Stiennon et al., 2020), OpenAI WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), StackExchange\\n(Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla).\\nWe collected a large dataset of over 1 million binary comparisons based on humans applying our specified\\nguidelines, which we refer to asMetareward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and\\nanswers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer\\nprompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our\\npreference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average.\\n3.2.2 Reward Modeling\\nThe reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous\\nturns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model\\ngeneration. Leveraging such response scores as rewards, we can optimizeLlama 2-Chatduring RLHF for\\nbetter human preference alignment and improved helpfulness and safety.\\nOthers have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it\\nchallenging for a single reward model to perform well on both. To address this, we train two separate reward\\nmodels, one optimized for helpfulness (referred to asHelpfulness RM) and another for safety (Safety RM).\\nWe initialize our reward models from pretrained chat model checkpoints, as it ensures that both models\\nbenefit from knowledge acquired in pretraining. In short, the reward model “knows” what the chat model\\n10'),\n",

This prevents cases where, for instance, the two models would have an information mismatch, which\\ncould result in favoring hallucinations. The model architecture and hyper-parameters are identical to those\\nof the pretrained language models, except that the classification head for next-token prediction is replaced\\nwith a regression head for outputting a scalar reward.\\nTraining Objectives. To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data\\ninto a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher\\nscore than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al. (2022):\\nLranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) − rθ(x, yr))) (1)\\nwhere rθ(x, y) is the scalar score output for promptx and completiony with model weightsθ. yc is the\\npreferred response that annotators choose andyr is the rejected counterpart.\\nBuilt on top of this binary ranking loss, we further modify it separately for better helpfulness and safety\\nreward models as follows. Given that our preference ratings is decomposed as a scale of four points (e.g.,\\nsignificantly better), as presented in Section 3.2.1, it can be useful to leverage this information to explicitly\\nteach the reward model to assign more discrepant scores to the generations that have more differences. To\\ndo so, we further add a margin component in the loss:\\nLranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) − rθ(x, yr) − m(r))) (2)\\nwhere the marginm(r) is a discrete function of the preference rating. Naturally, we use a large margin\\nfor pairs with distinct responses, and a smaller one for those with similar responses (shown in Table 27).\\nWe found this margin component can improve Helpfulness reward model accuracy especially on samples\\nwhere two responses are more separable. More detailed ablation and analysis can be found in Table 28 in\\nAppendix A.3.3.\\nData Composition. We combine our newly collected data with existing open-source preference datasets\\nto form a larger training dataset. Initially, open-source datasets were used to bootstrap our reward models\\nwhile we were in the process of collecting preference annotation data. We note that in the context of RLHF in\\nthis study, the role of reward signals is to learn human preference forLlama 2-Chatoutputs rather than\\nany modeloutputs. However, in our experiments, we do not observe negative transfer from the open-source\\npreference datasets. Thus, we have decided to keep them in our data mixture, as they could enable better\\ngeneralization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking, i.e.Llama 2-Chattaking advantage of\\nsome weaknesses of our reward, and so artificially inflating the score despite performing less well.\\nWith training data available from different sources, we experimented with different mixing recipes for both\\nHelpfulness and Safety reward models to ascertain the best settings.

In order for a single model to perform well on both\\ndimensions, it needs to not only learn to select the better response given a prompt but also to distinguish\\nadversarial prompts from safe ones. As a result, optimizing two separate models eases the reward modeling\\ntask. More detailed analysis on this tension between safety and helpfulness can be found in Appendix A.4.1.\\nWhen we group the scores by preference rating in Table 8, we can see that the accuracy is superior for the\\n“significantlybetter”testsetanddegradesgraduallyascomparisonpairsbecomemoresimilar(e.g.,“slightly\\nbetter”).

We emphasize that the accuracy on more distinct responses matters the\\nmosttoimprove Llama 2-Chatperformance. Thehumanpreferenceannotationagreementrateisalsohigher\\non more distinct responses than similar pairs.\\nScaling Trends. We study the scaling trends in terms of data and model size for the reward model, fine-\\ntuning different model sizes on an increasing amount of the reward model data collected each week (see the\\ndetailsonvolumeperbatchinTable26). Figure6reportsthesetrends,showingtheexpectedresultthatlarger\\nmodels obtain higher performance for a similar volume of data. More importantly, the scaling performance\\nhas not yet plateaued given the existing volume of data annotation used for training, a signal that there is\\nroom for more improvement with more annotations. We note that reward model accuracy is one of the most\\nimportant proxies for the final performance ofLlama 2-Chat.

Although we do not present specific\\nfigures, this adjustment demonstrated considerable enhancements in performance and effectively addressed\\nthe previously noted issues. This mitigation can be seen as analogous to Synnaeve et al. (2019) and Vinyals\\net al. (2019) in the RL literature.\\nWe illustrate the benefit of Rejection Sampling in Figure 7. The delta between the maximum and median\\ncurves can be interpreted as the potential gain of fine-tuning on the best output. As expected, this delta\\nincreases with more samples, since the maximum increases (i.e., more samples, more opportunities to\\ngenerate a good trajectory), while the median remains stationary. There is a direct connection between the\\nexploration and the maximum reward we can obtain among the samples. The temperature parameter also\\nplays an important role for exploration, as a higher temperature enables us to sample more diverse outputs.\\nIn Figure 8, we report for aLlama 2-Chat-SFT (left) and aLlama 2-Chat-RLHF (right), the maximum\\nreward curves among N samples (withN ∈ [1, . . . ,100]), for different temperatures. We can observe that\\nthe optimal temperature is not constant during the iterative model updates: RLHF has a direct impact on\\nrescaling the temperature. ForLlama 2-Chat-RLHF, the optimal temperature when sampling between 10\\nand 100 outputs isT ∈ [1.2, 1.3]. Given a finite compute budget, it is therefore necessary to re-adjust the\\ntemperature progressively.

We were able to mitigate this by consolidating the model weights to each node once before generation\\nand then freeing the memory after generation, resuming the rest of the training loop.\\n3.3 System Message for Multi-Turn Consistency\\nIn a dialogue setup, some instructions should apply for all the conversation turns, e.g., to respond succinctly,\\nor to“act as”some public figure. When we provided such instructions toLlama 2-Chat, the subsequent\\nresponse should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial\\ninstruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).\\nTo address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context\\nDistillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage\\nprocess. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).\\nGAtt Method. Assume we have access to a multi-turn dialogue dataset between two persons (e.g., a user\\nand an assistant), with a list of messages[u1, a1, . . . , un, an], whereun and an correspond to the user and\\nassistant messages for turnn, respectively. Then, we define an instruction,inst, that should be respected\\nthroughout the dialogue. For example,inst could be“act as.”We can then synthetically concatenate this\\ninstruction to all the user messages of the conversation.\\nNext, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue\\nand the sample with which to fine-tune a model, in a process analogous to Rejection Sampling. Instead of\\naugmenting all context-dialogue turns with the instruction, we can drop it in all but the first turn, but this\\nwould lead to a mismatch at training time between the system message, i.e., all the intermediate assistant\\nmessages that come before the last turn, and our sample. To fix this issue, which could hurt the training, we\\nsimply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.\\nFor the training instructions, we created a few synthetic constraints to sample from: Hobbies (“You enjoy\\ne.g. Tennis”), Language (“Speak in e.g. French”), or Public Figure (“Act as e.g. Napoleon”). To obtain the lists\\nof hobbies and public figures, we askedLlama 2-Chatto generate it, avoiding a mismatch between the\\ninstruction and model knowledge (e.g., asking the model to act as someone it had not encountered during\\ntraining).

Thus, to select the best-performing models among several ablations at each iteration from RLHF-V1\\nto V5, we first observed the improvement of the rewards from the latest reward models, to save costs and\\nincrease iteration speed. We later validated major model versions with human evaluations.\\nHow Far Can Model-Based Evaluation Go?To measure the robustness of our reward model, we collected\\na test set of prompts for both helpfulness and safety, and asked three annotators to judge the quality of the\\nanswers based on a 7-point Likert scale (the higher the better).

This can inform what, if any,\\ndownstream mitigations to consider, and help guide appropriate model use. In this section, we analyze the\\npretraining data for distributions of languages, demographic representations, and toxicity. We also present\\nthe results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.\\nSteps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly.We followed Meta’s standard privacy and legal review processes for\\neach dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain\\nsites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We made a best\\neffort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our\\nmodelsbroadlywillreducetheneedforotherstotrainsimilarmodels. Noadditionalfilteringwasconducted\\non the datasets, to allowLlama 2to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate\\nspeechclassification), whileavoidingthepotentialfortheaccidentaldemographicerasuresometimescaused\\nby over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allowsLlama 2-Chatto generalize more effectively during safety tuning\\nwith fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result,Llama 2models\\nshould be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.\\nDemographic Representation: Pronouns. Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited\\nfrom the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words\\nrepresenting “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing“men”than to words\\nrepresenting“women,”and Ganeshet al.(2023) demonstrates that amodel’sperformance onfairness metrics\\ncan be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic\\ngroups. Within our English-language training corpus, we computed the frequencies of the most common\\nEnglish pronouns in Table 9a. We observe thatHe pronouns are generally overrepresented in documents\\ncompared toShe pronouns, echoing similar frequency differences observed in pronominal usage for similarly\\nsized model pretraining datasets (Chowdhery et al., 2022). This could mean that the model is learning less\\nduring pretraining about context that mentionsShe pronouns, and subsequently may potentially generateHe\\npronouns at a higher rate thanShe pronouns.\\nDemographic Representation: Identities. We also analyze the representation of different demographic\\ngroupsinthepretrainingdatabymeasuringratesofusageofdemographicidentitytermsfromtheHolisticBias\\ndataset (Smith et al., 2022) as a proxy. We compute frequencies for each descriptor term in the pretraining\\ncorpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes (Religion, Gender and Sex, Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and\\nSexual Orientation), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few\\nterms such as“straight,” “white,”and “black,”because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic\\nmentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in\\nboth Gender and Sexand Sexual Orientation. ForGender and Sex, whileShe pronouns are mentioned\\nin fewer documents, the term“female” is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply\\nthat while there is less frequent context aboutShe pronouns, comments about“females”are more prevalent,\\nperhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms (Blodgett et al., 2021). ForSexual\\nOrientation, the top five terms all relate to LGBTQ+ identities. ForNationality,Race and Ethnicity, and\\nReligion, we observe a Western skew (Bhatt et al., 2022). For instance, the term“American”is mentioned in\\n69.4% of the references, the term“European”is more prevalent than other race and ethnicity, and“Christian”\\nis the most represented religion followed by“Catholic”and “Jewish.”\\n20'),\n",

Truthfulness, referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconcep-\\ntions or false beliefs. We employTruthfulQA(Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can\\ngenerate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense.\\n2. Toxicity,definedasthetendencyofalanguagemodeltogeneratetoxic,rude,adversarial,orimplicitly\\nhateful content. We chooseToxiGen(Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation\\nof toxic language and hate speech across different groups.\\n3. Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with\\ndemographic attributes.\\nWe compare the performance ofLlama 2with Llama 1(Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,\\n2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to0.1\\nand use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better). For ToxiGen, we\\npresent the percentage of generations that are deemed toxic by the metric (the lower, the better). Detailed\\ndescriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix A.4.7. When compared toLlama 1-7B,\\nLlama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in\\ntoxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70BLlama 2, which may result\\nfrom larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship\\nbetween pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical\\nwork to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and\\nfurther evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.\\nIn Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with\\ndemographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using\\nBOLDprompts. MoredetailedresultssplitbydifferentdemographicgroupscanbefoundinAppendixA.4.8.\\nLlama 2does not outperform other models on toxicity metrics, and we speculate that this may be because we\\nrefrained from aggressively filtering the pretraining data. Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may\\nenable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection),\\nand it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups. We observe that models\\ntrained from less aggressively filtered pretraining data also required fewer examples to achieve reasonable\\nsafety-alignment.

Further\\ntesting and mitigation should be done to understand bias and other social issues for the specific context\\nin which a system may be deployed. For this, it may be necessary to test beyond the groups available in\\nthe BOLD dataset (race, religion, and gender). As LLMs are integrated and deployed, we look forward to\\ncontinuing research that will amplify their potential for positive impact on these important social issues.\\n4.2 Safety Fine-Tuning\\nIn this section, we describe our approach to safety fine-tuning, including safety categories, annotation\\nguidelines, and the techniques we use to mitigate safety risks. We employ a process similar to the general\\nfine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.\\nSpecifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\\n1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-\\ntions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches\\nthe model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for\\nhigh-quality human preference data annotation.\\n2. Safety RLHF: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-\\ntion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging\\nadversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.\\n3. Safety Context Distillation: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation (Askell\\net al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety\\npreprompt, e.g.,“You are a safe and responsible assistant,”and then fine-tuning the model on the safer\\nresponses without the preprompt, which essentiallydistillsthe safety preprompt (context) into the\\nmodel. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use\\ncontext distillation for each sample.\\n4.2.1 Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines\\nBased on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to\\ncreate adversarial prompts along two dimensions: arisk category, or potential topic about which the LLM\\ncould produce unsafe content; and anattack vector, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts\\nthat could elicit bad model behaviors.\\nTheriskcategoriesconsideredcanbebroadlydividedintothefollowingthreecategories: illicitandcriminal\\nactivities(e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking);hateful and harmful activities(e.g., defamation, self-\\nharm, eating disorders, discrimination); andunqualified advice(e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal\\n23'),\n",

The attack vectors explored consist of psychological manipulation (e.g., authority manipulation),\\nlogic manipulation (e.g., false premises), syntactic manipulation (e.g., misspelling), semantic manipulation\\n(e.g., metaphor), perspective manipulation (e.g., role playing), non-English languages, and others.\\nWethendefinebestpracticesforsafeandhelpfulmodelresponses: themodelshouldfirstaddressimmediate\\nsafetyconcernsifapplicable,thenaddressthepromptbyexplainingthepotentialriskstotheuser,andfinally\\nprovide additional information if possible. We also ask the annotators to avoid negative user experience\\ncategories (see Appendix A.5.2). The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are\\niteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.\\n4.2.2 Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nIn accordance with the established guidelines from Section 4.2.1, we gather prompts and demonstrations\\nof safe model responses from trained annotators, and use the data for supervised fine-tuning in the same\\nmanner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5.\\nThe annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce\\nthe model to exhibit unsafe behavior, i.e., perform red teaming, as defined by the guidelines. Subsequently,\\nannotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce.\\n4.2.3 Safety RLHF\\nWeobserveearlyinthedevelopmentof Llama 2-Chatthatitisabletogeneralizefromthesafedemonstrations\\ninsupervisedfine-tuning. Themodelquicklylearnstowritedetailedsaferesponses, addresssafetyconcerns,\\nexplain why the topic might be sensitive, and provide additional helpful information. In particular, when\\nthe model outputs safe responses, they are often more detailed than what the average annotator writes.\\nTherefore, after gathering only a few thousand supervised demonstrations, we switched entirely to RLHF to\\nteach the model how to write more nuanced responses. Comprehensive tuning with RLHF has the added\\nbenefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts (Bai et al., 2022a).\\nWe conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section 3.2.2: annotators\\nwrite a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to\\nthe prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines. We then use the human\\npreference data to train a safety reward model (see Section 3.2.2), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to\\nsample from the model during the RLHF stage.\\nBetter Long-Tail Safety Robustness without Hurting HelpfulnessSafety is inherently a long-tail problem,\\nwhere the challenge comes from a small number of very specific cases. We investigate the impact of Safety\\nRLHFbytakingtwointermediate Llama 2-Chatcheckpoints—onewithoutadversarialpromptsintheRLHF\\nstage and one with them—and score their responses on our test sets using our safety and helpfulness reward\\nmodels. In Figure 14, we plot the score distribution shift of the safety RM on the safety test set (left) and that\\nof the helpfulness RM on the helpfulness test set (right). In the left hand side of the figure, we observe that\\nthe distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with\\nRLHF, and that the long tail of the distribution near zero thins out. A clear cluster appears on the top-left\\ncorner suggesting the improvements of model safety. On the right side, we do not observe any gathering\\npattern below they = x line on the right hand side of Figure 14, which indicates that the helpfulness score\\ndistributionispreservedaftersafetytuningwithRLHF.Putanotherway,givensufficienthelpfulnesstraining\\ndata, the addition of an additional stage of safety mitigation does not negatively impact model performance\\non helpfulness to any notable degradation. A qualitative example is shown in Table 12.\\nImpact of Safety Data Scaling.A tension between helpfulness and safety of LLMs has been observed in\\nprevious studies (Bai et al., 2022a). To better understand how the addition of safety training data affects\\ngeneral model performance, especially helpfulness, we investigate the trends in safety data scaling by\\nadjustingtheamount ofsafety dataused intheRLHF stage. In this ablationexperiment, we keeptheamount\\nof helpfulness training data unchanged (∼0.9M samples) and gradually increase the amount of safety data\\nused in model tuning, ranging from 0% to 100% (∼0.1M samples). For the specific training data mix recipe,\\nwe follow the procedure described in Section 3.1 and fine-tuneLlama 2pretrained model for 2 epochs.\\nWe eventually obtain 6 model variants trained with 0%, 1%, 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100% of the total safety\\ndata.

We\\ntrain a classifier for detecting refusals in responses and apply the classifier on 1) the above helpfulness test\\nsets and 2) a curated borderline test set consisting of 210 samples for the purpose of boundary testing similar\\nto OpenAI (2023).

We observe that the safety capabilities of LLMs can be efficiently\\nenhanced by prefixing the model with a safety preprompt (e.g.,“You are a safe and responsible assistant”).\\nLike supervised safety fine-tuning, safety context distillation provides a quick way to bootstrap the model’s\\nresponses on hard adversarial prompts, so that they can then be further improved in RLHF.\\nSpecifically, we apply context distillation by prefixing a safety preprompt to adversarial prompts to generate\\nsafer responses, and then fine-tune the model on its own safe output given the adversarial prompt without\\nthe preprompt. We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various\\nadjectivesusuallyassociatedwithsafebehaviorsuchas “responsible,”“respectful’,’ or“wise,”withtheintuition\\nthat the model associates them with positive traits that we want to see reflected in safe answers.

We therefore perform safety context distillation only on adversarial prompts.\\nHowever, we observed that context distillation can sometimes degrade response quality, even when dealing\\nwith adversarial prompts. Specifically, if the model responses are already of high quality, the application of\\ncontext distillation can result in less pertinent replies, as the model tends to overemphasize the preprompt,\\noften resorting to generic concerns excessively (see Appendix Table 40 for an example of vague answers due\\nto context distillation). We thus leverage the safety reward model to decide whether to use safety context\\ndistillation – we keep the context-distilled output only on the examples where it gets a better reward model\\nscore than the original answer.

After creating each dialogue, the red team participant would annotate various attributes, including\\nrisk areas and degree of risk, as captured by a 5-point Likert scale.\\nSome examples of useful insights provided by members of red teams that we were able to improve upon\\nthroughout development:\\n• [Early models] were more likely to have generated unsafe responses without noting that they con-\\ntain problematic content. However,[slightly later models] have tended to display knowledge\\nthat the content is problematic, even if they do go on to provide it.“They respond with ‘[UNSAFE\\nCONTENT] is not appropriate to discuss, etc.’ and then immediately follow up with ‘With that said, here’s\\nhow [UNSAFE CONTENT].’ ”[Latest models] are able to resolve these issues.\\n• Distracting the[early models] by including “quirks” or specific requests usually defeated any\\nreluctance encountered via more direct requests.“A creative writing request (song, story, poem, etc.) is a\\nreliable way to get it to produce content that it is otherwise robust against.”\\n• Embedding a problematic request in a positive context often successfully obscured the fact that\\nproblematic output was being requested for[early models]: “The overall principle I’ve found most\\neffective for any kind of attack is to hide it in language that is positive, progressive, and empowering.”\\nFrom Red Teaming Insights to Safer Models.Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough\\nanalysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-\\nformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk. In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide\\nto help further model safety training, and specifically took data from these exercises for model fine-tuning,\\nmodel feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.\\nMultiple additional rounds of red teaming were performed over several months to measure the robustness\\nof each new model as it was released internally. We defined the robustness of a model,γ, with respect to\\na red teaming exercise executed by a set of experts as the average number of created prompts that would\\ntriggeraviolatingresponsefromthemodelperpersonperhour. Asanexample, onour7Bmodel, wehadan\\nevolution ofγ : 1.8 → 0.45 over several red teaming iterations and model refinements.

At the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for\\nsupervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-\\nbility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement\\nlearning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore\\nthat the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs\\nthroughout the annotation process.\\nEven with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on\\nSFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Fur-\\nthermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human\\nannotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation\\nfor RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end\\ndistribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we\\ncan see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.\\nIn addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the\\nbestannotatorsmaynotchart. Nonetheless,humanscanstillprovidevaluablefeedbackwhencomparingtwo\\nanswers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished\\nartists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of\\nLLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as\\ndocumented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold\\nstandard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of “supervision.”\\nIn-ContextTemperatureRescaling.

As indicated in Figure 8, the temperature appears to be influenced by RLHF. Yet, intriguingly,\\nour findings also revealed that the shifts are not uniformly applied across all prompts, as shown in Figure 21.\\nFor instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as “Write a poem,” an increase in\\ntemperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the\\nSelf-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model.\\nOntheotherhand,forpromptsbasedonfactualinformation,suchas“Whatisthecapitalof?” theSelf-BLEU\\nslope diminishes over time.

Those who useLlama 2must comply with the terms of\\nthe provided license and ourAcceptable Use Policy, which prohibit any uses that would violate applicable\\npolicies, laws, rules, and regulations.\\nWe also provide code examples to help developers replicate our safe generations withLlama 2-Chatand\\napply basic safety techniques at the user input and model output layers. These code samples are available\\nhere: https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama. Finally,wearesharinga ResponsibleUseGuide ,which\\nprovides guidelines regarding safe development and deployment.\\nResponsible Release. While many companies have opted to build AI behind closed doors, we are releasing\\nLlama 2openly to encourage responsible AI innovation. Based on our experience, an open approach draws\\nuponthecollectivewisdom,diversity,andingenuityoftheAI-practitionercommunitytorealizethebenefitsof\\nthis technology. Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community—academic\\nresearchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose\\nthe risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This\\napproach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech\\ncompanies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued\\nin Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,\\ndemocratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI\\nexpertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress\\nin the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry,\\nallowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases.\\nUltimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe\\nto benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.\\nWe know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there\\nare reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and\\nproblematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this\\npaper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we\\nrecognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and\\ncollaboration with the AI community.\\n6 Related Work\\nLarge Language Models. The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\\nthis progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference\\n(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\\nsource models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon\\n(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.\\n§§https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n35'),\n",

These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with\\nhuman preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the\\nopen-source community.\\nAttempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\\nand Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set\\nby their closed-source counterparts.\\nInstructionTuning. Weietal. (2021)obtainedzero-shotperformance onunseentasksby fine-tuningLLMs\\non numerous datasets. Chung et al. (2022) and Longpre et al. (2023) investigate the impact of instruction\\ntuningasafunctionofnumberoftasks,modelsize,promptsettings,etc. Promptsusedforinstructiontuning\\ncan be created by humans or by LLMs themselves (Zhou et al., 2022), and follow-up instructions can be used\\nto refine initial generations to make them more useful, engaging, and unbiased (Ganguli et al., 2023; Madaan\\net al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in\\nwhich models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase\\nthe likelihood that their final answer is correct.\\nRLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant\\nimprovements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al.\\n(2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications.\\nIn this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the\\nmodels’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.\\nOuyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix\\nissues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai\\net al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled\\nfine-tuning data with the model’s own self-critiques and revisions, and by replacing human raters with a\\nmodel when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF).\\nKnown LLM Safety Challenges.Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked\\nwith Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards\\nlikebias,toxicity,privatedataleakage,andthepotentialformalicioususes. Solaimanetal.(2023)categorizes\\nthese impacts into two groups — those that can be assessed within the base system and those requiring a\\nsocietal context evaluation, while Kumar et al. (2022) offers potential mitigation strategies to curb harm.\\nWork from Roller et al. (2020) and Dinan et al. (2021) also illuminates the difficulties tied to chatbot-oriented\\nLLMs, with concerns ranging from privacy to misleading expertise claims. Deng et al. (2023) proposes\\na taxonomic framework to tackle these issues, and Bergman et al. (2022) delves into the balance between\\npotential positive and negative impacts from releasing dialogue models.\\nInvestigationsintoredteamingrevealspecificchallengesintunedLLMs,withstudiesbyGangulietal.(2022)\\nand Zhuo et al. (2023) showcasing a variety of successful attack types and their effects on the generation of\\nharmful content. National security agencies and various researchers, such as (Mialon et al., 2023), have also\\nraisedredflagsaroundadvancedemergentmodelbehaviors,cyberthreats,andpotentialmisuseinareaslike\\nbiological warfare. Lastly, broader societal issues like job displacement due to accelerated AI research and an\\nover-reliance on LLMs leading to training data degradation are also pertinent considerations (Acemoglu\\nand Restrepo, 2018; Autor and Salomons, 2018; Webb, 2019; Shumailov et al., 2023). We are committed to\\ncontinuing our work engaging with the broader policy, academic, and industry community on these issues.\\n7 Conclusion\\nIn this study, we have introducedLlama 2, a new family of pretrained and fine-tuned models with scales\\nof 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. These models have demonstrated their competitiveness with existing\\nopen-source chat models, as well as competency that is equivalent to some proprietary models on evaluation\\nsets we examined, although they still lag behind other models like GPT-4. We meticulously elaborated on the\\nmethodsandtechniquesappliedinachievingourmodels,withaheavyemphasisontheiralignmentwiththe\\nprinciplesofhelpfulnessandsafety. Tocontributemoresignificantlytosocietyandfosterthepaceofresearch,\\nwe have responsibly opened access toLlama 2andLlama 2-Chat.

We expand the context window forLlama 2from 2048 tokens to 4096 tokens. The longer\\ncontext window enables models to process more information, which is particularly useful for supporting\\nlonger histories in chat applications, various summarization tasks, and understanding longer documents.\\nTable 16 compares the performance of 2k and 4k context pretraining on long-context benchmarks. Both\\nmodelsaretrainedfor150Btokens,keepingthesamearchitectureandhyperparametersasabaseline,varying\\nonly the context length. We observe improvement on SCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2022), where the average\\ninput length is 3.5k, and no performance degradation on SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). Table 17 shows\\nthat the longer context model retains strong performance on various general-purpose tasks.\\nGrouped-Query Attention. A standard practice for autoregressive decoding is to cache the key (K) and\\nvalue (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation. With increasing\\ncontext windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache size in multi-head\\nattention (MHA) models grow significantly. For larger models, where KV cache size becomes a bottleneck,\\nkey and value projections can be shared across multiple heads without much degradation of performance\\n(Chowdheryetal.,2022). Eithertheoriginalmulti-queryformatwithasingleKVprojection(MQA, Shazeer,\\n2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\\nIn Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\\ntokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\\nMQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\\nlayers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\\nincrease it by a factor of1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the\\nMHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.\\nTo optimize for latency, we host our largest models using 8 A100s in a single node with tensor parallelism\\n(Shoeybi et al., 2019). In this setting, sharding for MQA cannot be done across heads anymore, given the\\nnumber of heads is lower than the number of GPUs. Either you duplicate the KV values in all GPUs (making\\nthe KV cache size equal to GQA), or an alternative is to shard across the batch dimension instead (Pope et al.,\\n2022). The latter, however, can complicate an inference service, as it works only when batch sizes are larger\\nthan the number of shards and the additional communication cost is not worth it in all cases.\\nContext NarrativeQA Qasper QuALITY QMSum ContractNLI SQuAD\\nLength (F1) (F1) (acc) (Rouge 1/2/L) (EM) (EM/F1)\\n2k 0.21 0.71 26.1 0.13/0.01/0.12 11.76 57.23/62.89\\n4k 17.26 18.52 29.6 15.08 /3.55/12.16 16.33 57.99 /64.46\\nTable 16: Context length ablation on long-context tasks.\\nContext Hella-Swag NQ TQA GSM8K Human-Eval\\nLength (0-shot) (64-shot) (64-shot) (8-shot) (0-shot)\\n2k 75.1 25.5 53.7 4.9 7.9\\n4k 74.8 25.5 52.2 6.5 7.3\\nTable 17: Context length ablation on general tasks.\\n47'),\n",

The first data point corresponds to batch\\nsize 1, and then we double it until the model runs out of memory. The MHA variant triggers an out-of-\\nmemory error at a batch size of 1024 for a context of 256 tokens and at a batch size of 128 for 2k context,\\nwhereas MQA and GQA have successful runs in those settings.\\nTherefore, based on the ablation results and ease of scaling inference, for the 34B and 70BLlama 2models\\nwe chose to use GQA instead of MQA.\\nFigure 24 shows how inference speed changed for the 30B GQA and MQA ablation models compared to the\\nMHA baseline, in an experiment using 8 x 80 GiB A100s with tensor parallelism. In these runs we simply\\nduplicated the KV heads for MQA in all GPUs, so the KV cache size for MQA became equal to the GQA and\\nthe two variants behaved very similar (with MQA just having a slightly larger FFN dimension).\\nA.2.2 Additional Details for Pretrained Models Evaluation\\nMMLU details.

In total, we collected 14 batches of human\\npreference data (i.e., Meta Safety + Helpfulness) on a weekly basis, consisting of over 1 million binary model\\ngeneration comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over\\ntime and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We\\nalso intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the\\naverage number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.\\nIn Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share\\nof samples with similar responses (e.g.,negligibly better or unsure) increase dramatically over time while\\nthose with stronger preference (e.g.,significantly better) drop in the meantime. This reflects the nature of our\\niterative model update and preference data annotation procedure - with better-performingLlama 2-Chat\\nmodels used for response sampling over time, it becomes challenging for annotators to select a better one\\nfrom two equally high-quality responses.\\nA.3.2 Curriculum Strategy for Meta Human Preference Data\\nHigh quality data is critical for alignment as discussed for SFT. We worked closely with the annotation\\nplatforms during our fine-tuning process, and opted for a curriculum annotation strategy. With the first\\nmodel,theannotatorswereaskedtomakepromptsrelativelysimple,andthentoprogressivelymovetowards\\nmorecomplexpromptsandteachingnewskillsto Llama 2-Chat.

We manually collected single turn prompts spanning the following categories: factual questions,\\nwriting and content creation, language assistance, recommendations, and dialogue. For multi-turn prompts,\\nannotators interacted with another model to generate a set of multi-turn prompts. To help ensure fairness,\\nwe asked annotators to collect multi-turn prompts by using four different interaction methods: (a) ChatGPT\\nas the interaction model, (b)Llama 2-Chatas the interaction model, (c) best response between ChatGPT\\nand Llama 2-Chatat every turn as selected by the annotators, (d) alternating between ChatGPT andLlama\\n2-Chat at every turn. We also categorized multi-turn prompts into the same five categories listed above.\\nSince it can be hard to categorize multi-turn prompts into a single category, annotators could select up to two\\ncategories for multi-turn prompts. Example evaluation prompts can be seen in Table 33.\\nFor open-source models, we collect generations using a context length of 1000 tokens and allow the model to\\ngenerate up to 1000 tokens. Even thoughLlama 2-Chatmodels are capable of handling up to 4000 tokens,\\nwe limit the context and generation length to 1000 tokens to provide a fair comparison with the open-source\\nmodels.

The scheme relies\\non the continuous influx of new investors to provide the funds needed to pay the returns\\nto earlier investors. It is named after Charles Ponzi, who became infamous for using this\\ntechnique in the early 1900s.\\nThe masterminds behind a Ponzi scheme typically follow a steps to set it up and carry it out:\\n1.

To understand the ability of LLMs to generate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and\\ncommon sense, we employ TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), used for LLM hallucinations to measure whether\\na language model is truthful in generating answers to questions while being informative at the same time.\\nThe TruthfulQA benchmark consists of 817 questions distributed across 38 categories, including but not\\nlimited to health, finance, law, and politics (Lin et al., 2021). The questions are designed in a way that even\\nhumans might answer incorrectly because of an unfounded belief or misconception. Following Lin et al.\\n(2021)weuseGPT-3-basedmetrics,whichhavebeenshowntohaverobustperformanceinpredictinghuman\\njudgments. Specifically, a fine-tuned GPT-3 model¶¶, i.e. a “GPT-judge”, is used to predict the truthfulness\\nand informativeness of the generated outputs from LLMs. For the QA prompt, we adopt a few-shot prompt\\ncontaining 6 random QA pairs with the formats following InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). We report the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative, as well as the percentage that are either\\ntruthful or informative.\\nToxicity. Tomeasurethedegreeofgenerationoftoxiclanguageandhatespeechacrossdifferentgroups, we\\nuseToxiGen(Hartvigsenetal.,2022),adatasetthatcontainsimplicitlytoxicandbenignsentencesmentioning\\n13 minority groups. We adopt a revised version of the dataset from Hosseini et al. (2023) that reduces noise\\nby filtering out prompts for which annotators disagree on the target demographic group. We then use the\\ndefault ToxiGen classifier tuned on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) to measure the toxicity of generations of each\\nof the LLMs.\\nBias. To study the sentiment in model generations that may vary with demographic attributes, we choose\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021), a large-scale bias benchmark that comprises 23,679 English Wikipedia prompts\\nspanning five domains of race, gender, religion, political ideology, and profession, with 43 different sub-\\ngroups∗∗∗. We conduct a sentiment analysis using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner\\n(VADER)(HuttoandGilbert,2014)toevaluatethesentimentsconveyedbythecombinationofpromptprefix\\nand model generation.

Table 44 presents evaluation results of TruthfulQA for the percentage of truthfulness,\\npercentage of informativeness, and percentage of both truthfulness and informativeness across\\ngenerations. Most of the models show a >90% informativeness in the model generations. However,\\nthe truthfulness percentage is relatively low for pretrained models, around 30% to 40% for Falcon,\\nMPT, and the 7BLlama 1. This percentage increases for pretrainedLlama 1and Llama 2with a\\nlarger size. After instruction fine-tuning, both 7B and 13BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 20% in\\ntruthfulness, 30BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 24%, and 70BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 14%\\ncompared to their pretrained versions.\\n• Toxicity.Table 45 shows that Mexicans, Latinos, and women tend to be the top three demographic\\ngroups with the highest percentages of toxic generations given ToxiGen prompts for the pretrained\\nmodels. Thanks to instruction fine-tuning, fine-tunedLlama 2-Chatmodels of all sizes show an\\neffectively zero percentage of toxic model generations, and hence their results are not presented here.\\n• Bias. Tables 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 present the distribution of sentiment scores across different\\ndemographic groups under the domains of race, gender, religious ideology, political ideology, and\\nprofession.

The ability of a fine-tuned chat model\\nto maintain context, handle nuanced situations, and avoid generating toxic content within a conversation\\nmay not be thoroughly evaluated by existing benchmarks. In the BOLD dataset, the prompts extracted from\\nWikipedia are taken to be the first five words plus the domain term, resulting in prompts in BOLD having six\\nto nine words, depending on the domain and demographic group (Dhamala et al., 2021).\\nAfter deployment, safety in chat models involves user experience and long-term effects, which are not\\ncaptured by benchmarks alone. Therefore, to assess safety effectively, additional testing of how they are\\nintegrated in a product deployment, how they are used, and what metrics accurately and precisely capture\\nsafety risks given the product context is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of safety.

Annotators that have scored an average of>4 have passed the training.\\nA.6 Dataset Contamination\\nWith the increasing scale of publicly available training data, it has become inevitable that some portion of\\nevaluation data is seen during training, and may provide an undue boost in evaluation performance.\\nEarlierwork(Brownetal.(2020),Weietal.(2022a),Duetal.(2022)inmeasuringsuchdatasetcontamination\\nconsidered an example from an evaluation set to be “contaminated” if there existed a collision between\\na high-ordern-gram (generally,n = 13) from the sample and the training data. This was a deliberately\\nconservative approach in order to produce a “clean” subset of the data with high precision, and is used in\\nopen-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).\\nThis approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,\\nand didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery\\net al. (2022), some datasets (such as BoolQ) contain contexts extracted verbatim from the web, but not the\\nquestion and answer continuation. As such, highly contaminated samples from these datasets are unlikely\\nto gain an unfair advantage. The methodology in Chowdhery et al. (2022) further improves on the earlier\\nn-gram collision detection by considering a sample to be contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at\\nleast once in the training data.\\nThe previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don’t appear to\\nconsider the formatting of prompts used for actual evaluation. In contrast, we instead match on tokenized\\ninput, being careful to pass fully verbalized evaluation samples to the tokenizer. We also diverge from the\\nprevious methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token\\nto be contaminated if it appears in any tokenn-gram longer than 10 tokens in both the evaluation sample\\nand the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a sample to be the percentage of tokens\\ncontaminated. Thisallowsustoviewthebenchmarkperformanceofourmodelsonarangeofcontamination\\nscales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with< 20% contamination)\\nand a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with> 80% contamination). In order to account for the\\nvagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens, so\\nthat matched spans between an evaluation sample and the training data can differ in at most four positions\\n(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).\\nWe identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee\\net al. (2022), modified to work on a PySpark cluster (effectively without random access to disk). Given the\\nembarrassingly parallel nature of the task, we are able to find all such 10-grams (and their full lengths) in\\nour entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.\\nAs there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has\\ncontributed to evaluation performance (mostly stemming from the fact that \"clean\" and \"dirty\" subsets do\\nnot necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In the event\\nof dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the \"cleanest\" examples to\\nhave an overallworseaverage score than their complement, and the \"dirtiest\" samples to have an overallbetter\\naverage score than their complement. It is insufficient evidence for contamination if only one of these were\\ntrue. To this end, we define four (non-disjoint) subset types as follows:\\n• “Clean”samples, with less than 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not clean”samples, with greater than (or equal to) 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not dirty”samples, with less than 80% token contamination,\\n• “Dirty” samples, with greater than (or equal to) 80% token contamination.\\nThere is an additional confounding factor that we attempt to address directly. With the given definition of\\ncontamination (as well as other definitions mentioned in the literature), there is a possibility that a sample\\n75'),\n",

The question is specifically about Llama2\\'s finetuning benchmarks. I need to look for sections or tables that mention \"Llama 2\" and \"Fine-tuned\" or \"finetuning.\"\\n\\nLooking through the context, I notice a section labeled \"Fine-tuned\" which includes \"Llama 2\" models with different sizes: 7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B. There are numbers listed, but without clear headers, it\\'s a bit confusing. I also see another table where \"Llama 2-Chat\" is mentioned with different benchmarks and scores. This might be part of the finetuning results.\\n\\nIn the text, there\\'s a mention of ablation experiments and hyperparameters, but that\\'s more about the training setup rather than the benchmarks themselves. There\\'s also a table showing results on standard benchmarks, but again, it\\'s not clearly labeled as finetuning.\\n\\nI think the key information is in the tables under \"Fine-tuned\" and \"Llama 2-Chat.\" These likely show the performance of Llama2 after finetuning across various benchmarks. The numbers probably represent scores or percentages in different categories.\\n\\nSo, putting it together, the answer should mention the models evaluated, the benchmarks used, and the performance metrics.

The results are presented in tables under the \"Fine-tuned\" section, with metrics such as percentages for \"true\" and \"info\" categories, along with an \"overall\" score. Additionally, a specific \"Llama 2-Chat\" model is evaluated, demonstrating its performance on benchmarks like \"true + info,\" \"true,\" \"info,\" and \"overall\" scores.

       "'<think>\\nAlright, I\\'m trying to figure out how to answer the question about the Llama2 fine-tuning benchmark experiments based on the provided context. Let me go through the context step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I see there are two main tables. The first one is Table 3, which seems to present overall performance on grouped academic benchmarks for models like 13B, 33B, 65B, and Llama2 with different sizes (7B, 13B, 34B, 70B). The metrics here are just numbers without labels, so it\\'s a bit unclear what each column represents, but it\\'s likely various benchmark tests.\\n\\nThen, there\\'s another section discussing fine-tuned models, specifically mentioning ChatGPT and Llama2. The numbers under Llama2 are listed by model size (7B, 13B, 34B, 70B) with a series of decimal values. These could be performance scores, maybe accuracy or F1 scores, across different benchmarks.\\n\\nThe context also mentions that for these models, the best score between their evaluation framework and publicly reported results is chosen. Table 3 is a summary of overall performance across grouped benchmarks, and the results for individual benchmarks are in Section A.2.2, which isn\\'t provided here.\\n\\nThe question is asking about the Llama2 fine-tuning benchmark experiments. From the context, I can gather that there are different model sizes (7B, 13B, 34B, 70B) and each has a set of performance metrics. The fine-tuned models have specific scores, but without more context, it\\'s hard to know exactly what each number represents.\\n\\nI think the answer should mention that the context includes data on Llama2 models of various sizes, their performance metrics, and that the results are part of a benchmark comparison. However, without more details on what the metrics stand for, the answer might be limited. So, I should probably state that there\\'s information on performance across different benchmarks for each model size, but specific details about the experiments themselves (like the setup or specific findings) aren\\'t provided in the context.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe context provides information on the performance of Llama2 models of various sizes (7B, 13B, 34B, 70B) across different benchmarks. The results are presented in tables, showing metrics for each model size, likely indicating their performance on specific academic tasks. However, the context does not offer detailed information about the experimental setup, methodology, or specific findings of the fine-tuning benchmark experiments for Llama2. Therefore, the answer is:\\n\\n\"I do not have enough information about this.\"'"

       "'<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out what logistic regression is based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\\n\\nThe context is from a section titled \"5.2 Regression\" in an appendix about Conjugate Distributions. It discusses minimizing an objective function and computing the gradient. There\\'s a mention of the gradient ∇J(θ) and an equation involving a sum of terms that include the exponential function and some other variables.\\n\\nI notice that the context talks about p(yi|xi,θ), which I recognize as the probability of y given x and parameters θ. It mentions that the gradient\\'s second term vanishes when p(yi|xi,θ) equals 1. This implies that the model tries to maximize p(yi|xi,θ) for each training point (xi, yi). \\n\\nFurther down, it says that the log of the odds (p(y=+1|x,θ) divided by p(y=-1|x,θ)) is equal to the inner product of some features φ(x) and θ. This makes me think that logistic regression is modeling the log-odds, which is a key characteristic of logistic regression.\\n\\nThe prediction function is mentioned as the sign of the inner product, which aligns with logistic regression using a sigmoid function to predict probabilities and then a threshold (like 0.5) to make binary classifications.\\n\\nThere\\'s also an equation for the objective function, which includes a sum of log terms involving the exponential function. This looks like the log-likelihood function for logistic regression, which is typically optimized using methods like gradient descent.\\n\\nAdditionally, the context mentions that the name \"logistic regression\" is a misnomer, but it doesn\\'t elaborate on that. \\n\\nPutting this together, logistic regression is a method used for binary classification. It works by modeling the log-odds of an event occurring, using a logistic function (sigmoid) to produce probabilities between 0 and 1. The model maximizes the likelihood of the training data, and the gradient calculation is crucial for updating the parameters during optimization.\\n\\nI think that covers the main points. So, logistic regression is a statistical method for binary classification that uses a logistic function to model probabilities based on given features.\\n</think>\\n\\nLogistic regression is a statistical method primarily used for binary classification. It models the log-odds of an event occurring by utilizing a logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function. This function transforms the linear combination of features into probabilities between 0 and 1. The model aims to maximize the likelihood of the observed data, and the parameters are typically optimized using gradient-based methods. The context also notes that the name \"logistic regression\" is considered a misnomer, though it is widely recognized and used in machine learning for its effectiveness in classification tasks.'"

Let me go through the context step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I see a mention of Figure 6, which reports trends showing that larger models achieve higher performance with a similar volume of data. This suggests that as the model size increases, its performance improves when trained on the same amount of data.\\n\\nNext, the context states that the scaling performance hasn't plateaued yet, given the current volume of annotated data used. This implies that there's still room for improvement if more data is annotated and used for training. So, increasing the data volume could lead to better model performance.\\n\\nAdditionally, there's a discussion about the reward model accuracy being important, and various training details like loss functions and evaluation metrics. However, the key points about scaling trends are tied to model size and data volume.\\n\\nPutting this together, the scaling trends indicate that larger models perform better with more data, and there's potential for further improvement as data increases.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe scaling trends for the reward model indicate that larger models achieve higher performance with a similar volume of data.
